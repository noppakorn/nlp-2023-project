479,"Julian is an eccentric guy and a good instructor. Even though the texts are old. Some of the things we read for this class made no sense to me, but if you listen to the lectures and take notes, you'll do alright."
480,Criteria is pretty clear. she's not a bad teacher. This class exposes you to a broad array of Spanish genres and writing styles from different time periods which I appreciated.
482,Dennis is very interesting and I find him very entertaining. He grades pretty easily as long as he can tell you put effort into the assignment.
483,"She gives such a good overview of the material that you'll need for the next years. the material is challenging. That being said, the quality of lectures is very good, lots of study materials and it is defiantly possible to do well with effort.the material is challenging.

486,she does not stick to her syllabus at all. The books are mostly fiction and worthless.  Only two books are factual.
488,"Yagoda was the best journalism professor I had at UD.  If you want an easy ""A,"" don't take his class. He's a nice guy overall, but very nit-picky and a bit inept at CONSTRUCTIVE criticism."
489,She is super sweet and encouraging and it was great learning from someone who lived in France and knows the culture. She cares so much about her students and it really shows. She is very understanding and a fantastic woman.
490,"Chandra is one of the worst professors to take a fundamental class with. The assignments are not heavy, but he expects you to do more than he assigned."
491,"She's nice, understanding, and helpful. She's very smart and very knowledgable about Shakespeare. I learned so much in this class and enjoyed every minute. Go to class everyday, you'll love it. Hard work, but so worth it."
492,Ross is one of the best professors at UD. Class was only 4 papers and he gave us extensions when he could tell we were all under stress. Class discussions are incredibly interesting and you'll never watch a film the same way again.
493,Professor Arena is very passionate and very educated about what he teaches. One of the most adorable people ever. I remember this man and what I learned in his classes. I refer to him constantly in my work.
494,"He's nice at first but makes for a mess of a professor. I have never been more confused in my LIFE. I  honestly think that if I had gotten a better professor I'd probably be doing a lot better in his class right now. He does give good feedback, but only sometimes. Other times it might just confuse you even more to ask for help."
496,He is very bad teacher. You have to work very hard. Don't take this class.

502,"I enjoyed this class. Papers are pretty easy, and as long as you take good notes on both the books and the lectures."
503,He's a really nice guy but the way he grades homework is actually ridiculous.  He never posted grades or kept track of grades so you don't even know how to fight your grade.
504,He's a funny and sweet man but test is very hard.
505,This professor is the worst ever. Lecture is very boring because of his voice.
506,he isn't very clear on what he wants all the time so you'll need to go to office hours for a better explanation. Absolutely the worst decision I've made at UD so far was to take a class with him. Most arrogant teacher I've ever met.
508,"Worst Professor I've ever had. His accent is very thick, i could barely understand him. He does not convey the lessons well whatsoever, a thick accent definitely acts as a language barrier, and the TA's he chooses are no better."
509,"She is a good professor if you watch the lectures, do the study guides and attend the review sessions."
510,She is one of the best professors. She make the material fairly easy and understandable and really wants everyone to do well.

541,"He is the cutest old man ever. he is an interesting professor. If you sign up for his class, be aware that Nauen may be the assistant professor and she is extremely boring. "
542,"The professor is nice, response to emails fast, and the essays and discussion posts aren't too bad. However, her quizzes have nothing to do with the lecture material, the modules have so much in them, and the discussions are loosely based off of the content."
543,"She is economically biased in her lectures and is not clear at all especially with the exam questions she uses. This makes the class too hard for an introductory level class.  She'll also skip over major topics that are ""not important""."
544,"This guy is a great professor to have for a film class because he is just in love with the movies. Although you get to watch movies every week, this isn't an easy class. There are 3 papers that make up your entire grade, and he grades the papers extremely hard. A traditional history class is much fairer in grading."

564,"Many students emphasize the importance of devoting a significant amount of time to homework and seeking help from the TA and professor during office hours. Some students mention the class being curved, which may be a factor to consider.

572,"There are only two exams and a research paper, which make up the bulk of the grade, and that it can be difficult to determine what is important from the lectures. Some students recommend doing the extra credit and reading the assigned books, while others feel that the exams are confusing and impossible to pass. Some students find Professor Roe to be disorganized and hard to follow, while others appreciate his enthusiasm for the subject.
