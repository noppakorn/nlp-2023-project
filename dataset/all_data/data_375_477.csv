375,"She is not the easiest grader and does appear to favor some students over another.  However, you can revise your papers and they aren't long papers, so its easy to revise till you get an A.  If you don't mind revising, then getting a good grade isn't that hard.  Otherwise, find a more flexible, fair-minded teacher for a better grade."
379,"Madame Kugler is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. She makes an effort to remember everyone's name and greet everyone at the beginning of class, and she really cares about each student's success. I will warn you that you have to be present and participate to pass, but it is not a hard class, even if you're bad at languages like I am."
381,"Literally the worst professor Ive had in my life. Extremely vague grading system where even if you do everything asked you STILL get bad grades for not doing it precisely as she wanted, barely any assignments so that if you do bad on a single one it brings your grade down a lot, and completely inflexible. No extensions allowed. Avoid at all costs."
387,"One of the best professors I've had in my college career. Really cares about the students, and their success. Tells fun and interesting stories about her experiences in Russia. I feel like I learned a lot this semester and didn't need to kill myself doing it."
388,Pemberton was one of my favorite professors at UD. She is so helpful and sweet and always willing to lend a helping hand. She's really patient and her class was pretty easy. Basically if she likes you you'll get a good grade!
389,"Prof. Blacker is super laid back in class and he doesn't really take attendance. Going definitely helps because he'll mention specific terms that are on the tests and taking/adding to your own notes in class is helpful. Other than the 3 exams, there's a short sitting ""presentation"" but that's the extent of the participation and grading."
391,"Professor Poole is absolutely amazing. Although she is a very difficult professor, she is always accessible to her students. If you are having trouble in class, go to office hours, as she is incredibly helpful and kind."
393,"Prof. Celli is one of the nicest professors I have had. She truly wants us to learn French and that comes through in her classes. She really encourages participation, which seems scary at first, but she appreciates the effort even if you make mistakes.  If you do the homework exercises, the tests are easy. Definitely would recommend!"
395,"Dee is the most incredible professor at Rhodes. If you have the chance to take her class, you will learn SO much. Her lectures feel more like a conversation - you can ask questions at any point, & she never fails to make you laugh! She is very accessible outside of class and gives great advice, not only for her classes but also for life. "
398,I liked his class. Sure he can be a little boring at times but that doesnt mean the stuff he chooses to present isnt interesting. I mean you cant teach at Rhodes that long and not be able to just rock the material
399,"Dr. Krumpe is amazing. He is very respected and a super caring professor. He will put in the work with you based on how much work you put in. He is super flexible and will stay late on campus to help you learn. I recommend taking him if you're an athlete; he understands your schedule. He is a challenging professor, but be ready for lots of notes. "
402,"Not very clear on what he is looking for - makes writing papers a bit confusing. Class can be boring at times, but overall, not too bad. It's easy."
403,"Professor Cotter is awesome! Take him if you have the chance, especially if you are a marketing major. He has real life experience to share that relates to everything he teaches which makes lectures interesting and helps you retain information. There are only 3 tests that make up your grade, but he teaches right from the test."
407,"Amazing teacher. Keeps even the most terrible information fun and interesting. Grading is straight forward and clear. Always willing to help you if you're struggling. Easy person to talk to and be around. Expects a lot, but it's never too much. All of her assignments can be done the day before easily, most are note packets."
411,"Professor Newton gets a bad rep, I was warned about how hard of a grader she is and how strict she is. That was not my experience at all, she comes off as strong and stern, but after a few lectures it's obvious that she has a good sense of humor and wants us to do well. She sets clear expectations and if you follow them it's fairly easy to do well."
412,Great Professor; Very Helpful; Challenging
413,By far my favorite professor at UD. Gives great feedback on assignments and genuinely cares about his students and what he's teaching. Class was discussion based on documentaries and readings and would go out of his way to help.
417,"Had to learn most course material on my own, taught very little. Did not grade any assignment until last minute after finals. Very stressful and unorganized."
418,"Not helpful one bit, very unclaer on things and due dates. Nice guy though, funny, easy class."
419,Good professor--native english speaker and very helpful.  Take her section!
422,"St. Pierre is hands down the best professor at UD. Makes class enjoyable with humor and does an outstanding job teaching the challenging material. If you come to class with book and study the homework/class notes, you should do great in this class."
423,"This is the hardest professor I've ever had. She packs WAY too much info into one class and her tests are nearly impossible. She doesn't give study sheets and you can't keep previous exams to study for the CUMULATIVE final. If you don't have to, don't take this professor"
424,"Prof. Haberkorn was great! He was one of those men who you could learn more from hearing stories about him and his beagle rather than lectures on his class. He was also rather old and walked as if he was a newborn deer on ice. Aside from all that, I learned a lot in his class. He also never made mistakes on grading tests or papers which was good!"
425,"VERY BORING! His lectures do not correspond with his tests. Puts questions on tests that weren't even covered in the chapters assigned. A lot of movies that will put you to sleep, only watches the beginning and expects you to know everything about the play. Relates everything to sex...(notice no pepper by his name) TRY TO GET A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR!"
426,he's definitely the best teacher i've had so far at bcc..i love the stories he tells plus he makes the class so much fun rather than a prof who does nothing but lecture with no enthusiasm..im definitely going to try and take another class of his because he is so awesome
431,"Easily one of the best professors I have ever had. She cares about her students and the field that she works in. She has great stories and hosts great lectures! I cannot rave enough about this professor. Definitely, if you get the chance, take a class with this professor."
432,Very passionate and engaging lecturer who does a great job of making some complex and weird ideas easy to understand. There are four tests and the clicker questions as your entire grade. Fairly easy class where paying attention is rewarded. 
433,"He was definately the most entertaining professor I've had so far in college. He is one of the sweetest men I have ever met and is always willing to help his students if they take the time to ask. It's easy to get him to go off on tangents, and if you ask, he'll show you his ice-skating videos. He's great....easy B, at least."
434,"Dr. Smith is probably the sweetest professor you will meet. It is obvious that she cares so much about her students. She was extremely helpful, especially if you go to her office hours. If you don't understand something, she will work with you as long as it takes until you understand. Only negative thing is, paper and exam were very difficult."
435,"Extremely disorganized and unclear. We never knew when things were due, there were no rubrics for grading and criteria was completely unknown, and we could never accomplish all of what she intended in class because she would get very long-winded. Avis is very opinionated and it intimidated people into not expressing their thoughts."
437,"Diann is a very tough grader. Her lectures are well explained, but if you do not study outside of class, you will not pass. I have never felt like such a mediocre student in my life, and I had to WORK for this B. She's very willing to help outside of class, so definitely reach out if you need. It will help you tons."
439,"This guy is terribly boring, not to mention not very friendly. He also talks about his steel drum band constantly. But he's pretty easy and cancels a lot."
441,Great advisor! Always willing to listen and to help.
445,"He is so caring and kind, but having him on a Monday 6-9 was not the best choice! He has a very monotone voice which makes this class hard to listen to because it is late at night. I wish this class was not a 6-9 because it would be so much more engaging. Your expectations are clear, his lectures are just confusing at times. It is an easy A!!"
446,"Funny guy. Willing to help. Tests are challenging so study, read, and take good notes. Angus cruise field trip wasn't the greatest but still entertaining. Can be a tough grader. Interesting class."
449,Avoid this Professor at all costs! He grades hard with extremely vague directions. Very exam heavy. Rarely responds to emails and when he does they are often very short and not helpful. He had zero idea how to use technology. Never posted a single grade the whole semester. He would also yell at students for not understanding the material.
450,Great guy.  Makes class fun and tries to entertain.  Doesn't scare anyone away from business careers.  Extra credits let students teach students.  Always willing to talk to you about anything.   He can relate to college students.  I would have him again.
451,"Excellent professor. Always available via email for help in this hybrid style course. Grades hard on homework, but is more lenient on exams. He is a great lecturer, provides useful tools and videos for reference and is very honest/funny during class. You wont regret you took this class because you learn the materials well. Beware of final project."
453,Professor Fitzgerald is very rude and quite frankly needs to retire. He emailed his students multiple times complaining about us because we had too many questions for him. He messed up our grades on multiple occasions and got upset when we brought it to our attention. Never recommending him to anyone. EVER.
456,"Professor Katz is a hard-working guy that also wants you to be a hard worker. His class isn't easy and he will really want you to participate and work hard. In the end, you'll become a much better writer. He's also nice to talk to and always has interesting things to say"
457,"One of the best teachers I've ever had. He's super organized, clear, and very good at explaining the purpose of learning what we learn in class and how it relates to the bigger picture"
458,"he has the ability to make the class outstanding, and interesting.  but he kills all discusion as soon as he opens his mouth.  he is borring, and slow and i felt like my time was wasted."
462,"Excellent professor, very personable and approachable.  Knows her stuff"
464,"Very nice guy, tries to be funny  and on occasion he's successful.   Good teacher, typical Keynesian though."
466,"Prange was very funny. However, her funnyness didnt mean that the work was easy. The work was hard to me. It required a whole lot understanding what she said. She wrote in script which coule be, at times, annoying because you cant read it. When you are writing notes she speeds up and you cant get a full grasp of the material that she gives."
468,She is an excellent teacher. She explains everything you need to know very thoroughly and she makes it very easy to understand.
470,"He is a great professor, gives excellent feedback, and cares for his students. The only thing is that he does not use canvas; his way of communication is by email. This course requires a coursebook, and there is lots of homework. Overall, he is a great professor."
471,"She is very compassionate with her subject of teaching. I really liked her positive and uplifting personality. And the fact that she is very understanding and makes it her goal to get students to become more ignited in their speeches, helping the audience feel a sense of connection is the best part of her class."
476,"Professor Garrison is very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, she has a lot of busy work that she only collects once in awhile and her lectures are exceedingly boring. However, the powerpoints are posted online."
477,"Do not take him. He is outdated, class does not make sense, so much pointless reading required. Harsh grader, syllabus and online assignments do not match. I didn't do a second part of an assignment because of this. You need to double check all deadline in the syllabus and online."
