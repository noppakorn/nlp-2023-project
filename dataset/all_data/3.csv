275,I loved him but I could see where some people might not. He did a wonderful job getting into the text and explaining the details that might have been missed. I don't think he was a hard grader he just knows what he wants. He was REALLY bad about the papers in that he waited to the LAST min to give them out. He is also extremely friendly and helpful
278,"Prof. Martin teaches like a high school teacher. He focuses more on following unnecessary rules than teaching. Rules include non to few restroom breaks per class, marking students tardy for showing up even a minute late, grading on absences, and leaving early regardless of the reason. While his lectures are okay, his attitude makes him intolerable."
280,Very intimidating.  Demands strict adherence to NASW code of ethics but justifies violation in lecture and advising sessions.  Yells in class at the top of his lungs.  Teaches from the book on occassion otherwise rambles on.  Deviates from a large syllabus. Made offensive personal remarks in class.
282,"Your garunteed to walk out of this class with at least a B  These are some of his first words to you when you come to class.  He is rather entertaining, not a bad guy outside of class, but not really a great teacher.  the class is wotrh a shot, and really not as bad as other have made it out to be"
285,"Rogness was an awesome prof. He is always willing to help students. If you study extensively for the midterm and final (his only tests), you will be fine. He is picky with grading (I got marked for not stapling my paper!). I feel like he did not explain SAS as good as he could but overall, great prof. I recommend."
287,"This was the most pointless, boring class I have ever taken. The professor is very unclear regarding what is expected of you and his grading is all over the place. He is a nice guy and seems to care about his students, but his class was a waste of time and a lot of work. I wouldn't recommend him nor would I recommend LIB 100 in general."
288,"Best class I have ever taken in USC. He was so enthusiastic about what he teaches, always willing to help his students or to discuss anything with his students. Exams are writing essays based on readings and lectures. there's no right/wrong answer but you need to develop your arguments logically. Pay attention to his lectures and do the readings!"
290,"Easily the best professor that I have ever had. She is clear, knowledgeable, and always interested in what you have to say. She helps anyone who needs it, even if it has nothing to do with the class and will help you with every step to reach your goals. Inspirational, supportive, and requires more than 350 characters to describe."
292,Worst teacher I've ever had in my entire educational career.  Complained to the dean about him. The dean said they get complaints all the time but there is nothing they can do about it.  Attending lecture is pointless as he is incomprehensible some days.  Better off staying home and memorizing the powerpoints he post since he just reads from them.
294,"Professor Schneider is nice, but I did not learn anything new from taking her course. She does talk about herself quite often, which cuts into class time. The class was easy, but I felt like I wasted a lot of money. I would recommend taking another professor, simply bc I didn't gain anything from her."
295,"Care about your GPA? Don't take professor Haidar's class. He grades awfully, it is his way or the highway. There were many occasions where I or my peers would get a correct answer and show work, but he didn't like it, so he marked it wrong. He knows the material, just doesn't know how to teach or communicate concepts to the students."
296,Professor Wells is average. The classes are all lectures and the grades come from the work done outside of class. Homework is about 5-10 hours a week. He mixes up his vocabulary sometimes which may confuse you. Each portfolio meeting determines your grade but the final meeting grade on that is all that matters. Focus on the portfolio.
298,"She's a very nice lady, but the class is terribly boring. Read the books and you'll be fine for the tests. Uses power points a lot, and her lectures are usually very boring. Videos are usually entertaining because of how ridiculous they are."
300,Prof Yu is so sweet & likes to connect with her students. She likes for her students to participate & share their experiences relating to the class materials. The textbook homework is easy. A few reading responses & take home exercises. she is very clear ab what is on exams & both were taken online. such a kind woman who really loves her job
302,This man should not be allowed to teach.  Way too critical and aggressive.
303,"Great prof, very caring and nice as a person but had some weak points in her teaching skills. Was always upbeat and lectures were never boring. She is excellent in explaining things but goes through information very fast so always ask for another example or for her to slow down and she will."
309,"Dr Leidig's class was really enjoyable and very different. We read two novels about IT managers to show what it is like in IT departments. Then in class we talk about what lessons can be learned from the cases, Leidig has years of experience and shares examples. Engage with him in class and give your opinion, you will get a higher grade."
310,"I really like professor White. She is very nice and cares about her students. The papers can be a lot to write and revise multiple times, but she makes it very manageable! The activities online are fairly easy and quick. She gives great feedback and wants to see you succeed. The grading criteria is very clear and straightforward"
311,"Fun Italian man...makes lectures as fun as they can get, I guess.  Take home tests...if you miss less than 2 classes, you don't have to take the final!  Overall, a pretty good prof!"
314,"Paul is an interesting dude. One second he is complimenting you and giving good feedback, and the next second he is being unclear in the directions, and tearing your project apart. By the end of the class you end up learning a lot without even realizing it, and producing really good work, but you'll probably pull your hair out and curse his name!!"
315,"Hunt is an amazing person and is hilarious. She tries to keep everyone engaged and you can tell she loves what she does. With that said, this class is not easy. You will work your butt off to maintain a good grade and that still isn't enough sometimes. Her exams are super conceptual and HARD. Take Hunt but be ready to work!"
316,"Larry cares about his students & makes sure everyone understands. He talks a tad fast but you to get used to it. Lectures are very engaging & he includes quick personal stories. Not mandatory to go, but the in class videos are always on exams. 4 exams & 5 quizzes, both lowest are dropped. There's an optional paper if you want to increase your grade"
321,"He is really hard, I would not recommend taking him unless you have lots of spare time. He is really funny and a great teacher, but if you do not understand the material in class, you are out of luck. The class is very fast-paced and he assigns tons of homework. Do not take him if you have a learning disability because he does not understand them."
322,"Worst class I have ever taken.He is arrogant, self-righteous, condescending, and offensive-needs to make the world feel stupid so he can feel smart. Lectures are pointless. If you must take the class, buy the testbank, where almost all test Q's come from"
326,"Great guy, but a VERY difficult teacher... be prepared to work. He tends to favor people who have a passion for the subject. Lots of opportunities to improve your grade though. Extremely difficult, but most interesting class I've ever had."
329,"Prof. Jinn is a very nice guy and has an interesting sense of humor. He uses relevant examples in his lectures , he loves when you ask questions and is always willing to help. My only problem was that I'm not very good at math so it was hard for me to maintain a B. The tests were a little hard to understand but overall, he's pretty good."
331,"His class can be challenging. The lectures are dull at times, and he tends to be a tough grader. But I wouldn't worry too much. He allows unlimited rewrites on every paper except the final. Tripp's an amazing professor. He's funny, caring, and truly wants his students to succeed. At office hours, we talked about fall break and new movies. Great guy"
332,Quite possibly the worst excuse for a teacher I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of being charged with.  To say he can't teach is an understatement.  I'm also not completely sure that HE understands the material we're supposed to be learning.  Mumbles a lot and reads directly from slides that were - no doubt - downloaded right from the web. Stay away!
335,"Great teacher & very helpful. Homework isn't mandatory, but do it and you'll be prepared for exams. Although exams are on exactly what she says, read questions CAREFULLY. She can word things to where you might be tricked. 3 exams & a final, quizzes are easy points, attendance is mandatory. Overall wonderful person"
336,"She is so helpful during office hours but make sure you put in an honest effort and know what questions you want to ask. Also get a study group together because it is very helpful. Do the ""homework"". She is a fair person and while can sometimes make you feel bad, you just improve from her criticisms."
337,"Theres these in class questions every time the class meets, which for me was three days out of the week. Theyre impossibly difficult and no matter how hard I studied for them I still managed to get a good handful wrong. For lecture she reads straight from the book and doesnt explain any of the material. She was kind, and all exams were online."
341,"Hes by far one my my favorite professors here! He's so nice, understadning, and makes lecture/lab alot of fun and interesting, cant say that about many profs. He is very clear on what to expect for exams and doesnt expect you to know every detail but the main concept to your understanding. Hes a pretty easy grader I would say compared to most."
342,"A great guy! He is so kind and allows you to do test corrections on one exam grade that you would like to raise. The material is understandable and he does not try to try trick you in any way on the exams. As long as you do the study guides he posts, you will be prepared . Exams themselves are very fair and he wants everyone to do well! :)"
345,"Lori can be misread. Although she seems to have 'low self-esteem', as someone else mentioned, she is really just quiet. I've had her for a few classes, and her sense of humor is actually excellent. A small snicker from her, though, is like a bellowing laugh from anyone else.Great professor, willing to help, and very engaging. A lot of reading, tho!"
347,The is one entertaining professor.  Hard classes but learn alot. Really cares.
348,"He is a great guy and he is willing to help you!!Class is ok, but if you ask questions and be attentive you will be fine!!!"
349,Although is attire can be shocking...he is really funny!  Pretty easy too!
351,"Professor Smith was a very good teacher. He knows a TON about the biographies behind the authors we read, which often illuminate the text to a whole new level. He is quiet, but only hard to hear when fools in class are chattering. Easily aced his tests, just paid attention. Grades papers pretty softly, not much nit-picking on grammar (thank god)."
352,Professor Byars is awesome!! She lectures out of the book and doesn't use powerpoints so be prepared to take notes. She has a great sense of humor and keeps class fun. Tests are easy and she gives a study guide which will have everything on the test. Class isn't challenging but it's a 100 level. Definitely recommend taking her!
353,Comes across very cold. Difficult exams. Most students have her early (fresh/soph year) and she is DEMANDING - be prepared to WORK. Will help if approached. In my opinion she is too touch on her students for the type of material taught - I have seen much better approaches. Suggest u find another sec
357,"Milt was great!  The class readings were a little dry, lecture was sort of dull, but he was such a nice "
359,"A little disorganized at times, but totally invested in French as a subject and lifestyle, as well as his students as individuals. Really laid back and very flexible. The nicest guy ever, and really funny."
360,"Dr Whipps can be a little difficult to hear as she speaks softly but her words carry a lot of weight.  Assignments every week lots of classroom group interaction, if you are shy you will need to get over it because you will be talking to classmates often.  Take Lib 301 BEFORE you take lib495 and start working on your research paper."
362,Pestana is an extremely wise man. He knows exactly what he's talking about. He's funny and makes lectures as interesting as he can. I had trouble in the beginning with the material and he made accommodations to make sure I'd succeed in the class. He genuinely cares about his students and their experience in his class. I highly recommend taking him
364,He is a really interesting professor. Classes are spent reading the pieces so you really don't have to read out of class and there is no participation necessary. He doesn't use BB which is annoying cause you don't know how you're doing. He is a really nice guy though and you only write 3 papers. That's your grade right there.
366,He is a very nice guy but is not a good teacher. He is super knowledgeable and there is little work required for this class.The exams are impossible and even though they are a scan tron it takes him about two months to get them back and you just get to see your grade.Also it is nearly impossible to get an A.If you want a good grade do not take him.
368,"Professor Blumreich is one of the toughest English professors I have had at GVSU. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed taking her Literary Responses to Death and Dying class. We read a TON, but everything was interesting and made for a great in-class discussion every week. I would recommend her if you are looking for a challenging and helpful prof"
369,Prof Tyson is the best prof ive ever taken at GV. Her class is enjoyable and she makes it interesting. She accepts everyones opinions and will never tell a student that their ideas are wrong. The readings she assigns are great reads and the quizzes are over context and she gives alt quests! TAKE HER! GV is lucky to have her as a professor.
370,"Class is challenging and although he's a nice guy, teaches as if you already are an expert in the subject. Moves quickly and not the best lecturer, but study hard and you can do well. Textbook not needed"
371,"Professor Carlson is very smart, but he jumps around in lectures which makes it very hard to understand what he is talking about. He does not use prepared notes, so you are expected to take notes based on what you understand about the topics. I would not recommend him if you struggle with science classes."
