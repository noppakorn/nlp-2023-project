3,"Pros:clear plans for the whole semester, course plan and grading standards are good, software is good, never late or absent, a knowledgable professor.        Cons:he is always explaining but not teaching, need to go learn in the book by yourself; examples are modification of tests but terrible handwriting so hard to understand, really boring class."
15,"Kubelka might be the worst professor that I have had at sjsu. I have found that watching a 5-10 minute youtube video is often more helpful that his lectures. He teaches straight from powerpoint, occasionally writing some stuff on the board. His tests are nothing like the homework. Tests are proof based and the homework is more calculations based."
18,Terrible teacher. Lectures are slow and repetitive. Course breadth is extremely narrow. He does not speak good English. He cannot see well enough to read read and makes constant typos. Homework assignments are poorly given without full explanation of grading criteria. He gives free grades increases and extra credit for helping him outside of class.
29,"Great Professor! Would take him again. He is super caring and has a loving and warm attitude, which makes class easy to go to. Take him if you can. Class is paper heavy there are no tests. Gives good instruction on papers though."
45,"He is a better professor than others would indicate.  He cares about students and wants to make a positive impact in their lives.  I only have two issues: there is too much homework and studying for a 0-credit class and the concepts may (only sometimes) be a bit simplistic and specific only to certain situations.  Overall, he is a good professor."
47,"My favorite professor I've had so far! He had such enthusiasm and made a lot of things that could have been boring very interesting. He could be a bit confusing at times, but always went back to go over things we weren't clear on. His exams were very fair and easy as long as you study from the problem sets he provided. Awesome guy, learned a lot."
48,"this class isnt hard, it just goes by slowly. Some of the material is kinda interesting but overall its boring. Shes a nice lady but she reads straight from the notes, so if you miss class you wont miss much."
57,"Absolute sweetheart! She really loves/cares about her students, and knows why literature is important.  Two 10 page papers, a midterm, and a final.  Good reading, she connects it with your life and past historical events. GREAT ENGLISH TEACHER, and GREAT PROFESSOR OVERALL.  I LOVE HER!"
58,a great professor who genuinely cares about his students and trusts them. he is a personable guy and respects everyone's opinions. attendance isn't taken but there are quizzes each class. even though I was allowed two skips I didn't take any because I actually wanted to be in class.
73,"Lecture is completely useless, slides make no sense the first time you see them, and it doesn't help that he blazes through them. Labs are idiotic, and don't help you learn anything, and the text sucks. You'll fail a quiz or two but whatever, everyone does. Discussion was surprisingly helpful. Overall though the class was horrible, as was Xiao."
74,"SHe was very nice and very funny.  Class was easy at first, but got really hard really fast.  She was not helpful, was very bad at explaining things and gave really bad examples.  She did not teach us how to do the assignments for the required lab.  Took way too many hours a week and I was barely able to pass the class."
90,"I took two of his classes so far and enjoyed myself during the lectures. He is passionate about in-class interaction and gives good feedback if you ask for it. Writing, reading, and participation matter in his class since homework is based on textbook understanding and exams are based on lectures comprehension. Great instructor of Asian PHIL study!"
92,"His lectures are so frustrating: he just stands at the board and rambles on without actually checking if you understand it or not.  He gives a normal amount of homework which are pretty hard, but the test questions are always easier than the homework.  You have to put in a lot of individual effort in order to do well."
94,"Very bad professor. if you took AP Biology in high school you should be fine but if you didn't youre out of luck. She goes so fast and just reads off her power points. Tests very hard, 3 and a final(not cumulative). Relied on labs, group projects and the curve."
98,Excellent professor. Highly recommend his course. Very knowledgeable and friendly.
100,"One of the worst classes I have ever taken. The lectures were boring, he solely read off the slides. The exams were fairly difficult and stressful because they were the only thing that counted for a grade. You never actually know you grade either because he goes off of the class average for grading, so we never really knew."
102,"Subject matter and lectures are dry, and there are a lot of them. Overall, Dr. Link explains things pretty clearly and I never had to ask him any questions. He's kind of crotchety when it comes to technology, so be warned about him responding to your emails. Homework is really easy and is actually helpful for tests. Study and you'll do fine"
104,"Best Professor I've ever had. Lectures are clear, concise, and fascinating. Brophy demonstrations lots of knowledge and passion in his field. He covers a lot of detail, but hey, that's how you learn! There are a lot of required readings, but most are interesting. He's not a hard grader to boot. Cannot recommend highly enough."
107,"Boorse is one of the funniest professors I've had at UD. Great sense of humor and extremely intelligent. If you practice problems, logic quickly becomes very interesting and doable. Make a good effort and you'll get a B. 3 tests, first 2 are easy, final is difficult. Class not mandatory but don't skip or you'll be lost. I recommend him."
110,"Dr. Smith is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his area of study and it clearly shows in his teaching. The material is challenging, but you should do okay if you pay attention and take good notes. The lab section of this class is horrendous, but you just have to grit your teeth and do it. Smith makes 8am class not entirely terrible."
111,Worst teacher I have ever had.  Total jerk when you try to get help from him.  Discourages class discussion in a PHILOSOPHY class!!!
114,"Awesome teacher.  Laid back, and explains material very thoroughly. More than willing to answer questions and will often find a way to help you answer your own questions. Will give help if you ask for it."
127,"A very bitter man. You'll never be inspired by him. Otherwise, an easy A if you turn in your stuff on time."
128,"By far the best professor I have ever had! I highly recommend taking Duff. His lectures can be boring, but it's college we're talking about. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to do well and improve. Loved him and wish he was my teacher for every class!!"
131,"He really wants to make you think and learn, not just spit back information.  He's a great guy who makes physics fun and worth all the work you have to put into the class."
132,"Rachana knows how to make her class fun and interesting for everyone regardless of their major or background. She really strives to make everyone feel included and represented and ensures that everyone has a voice in the classroom. She tends to be a bit disorganized, but it's in a fun English teacher kind of way."
137,I was looking forward to this class and was grossly disappointed. Her lecture information is poorly organized and difficult to follow. She doesn't know how to operate anything electronic including turning off caps lock. Her tone and mannerisms are abrasive and obnoxious. Expect to get a snarky response when you ask her to clarify herself and exams.
141,"Grades on class participation but argues any point you bring up making you not want to participate.Very combative. He is ALWAYS right.Comments on paper are not helpful.Not a good communicator of expectations on assignments. If you can get through all of that, there are moments when he says something profound."
142,"Overall, a pretty average class experience. The exams weren't terrible and there was not a crazy amount of work. Lectures definitely get boring and attendance is mandatory if you want the notes, but I have definitely had worse. "
147,"A truly devoted professor and wonderful mentor. He lives and breathes literature, and he really inspires his students to work hard and react personally to the text. Kind, perceptive, and invested in his students. If you want a challenging but fulfilling English experience, take a class with him. It's so sad that he's only here for one more year!"
150,"Professor Levenburg is a very smart person, but not a good professor at all. This is my first time ever writing a review in my four years at Grand Valley. She is a professor who is relatively easy but not worth taking. She is disrespectful to her students when they ask a simple question. Constantly makes mistakes when going over examples, no good."
151,Dr. Good is a realy great proffessor. He really wants his students to do well in his class. Make sure you read the book and his powerpoints. The test weren't too difficult just make sure you read. Studying the powerpoints alone won't get you a good grade. Overall a great prof!
152,Dr. Brewer is a really nice guy but his tests are very challenging. Good students still may not do well. His exam averages are in the 50's most of the time and a lot of students drop his class. He does have great knowledge of the subject though.
154,"I. Love. Dr. Salzarulo. Lectures are straight to the point and he provides a lot of insight through (surprisingly interesting) real-world applications. He does mini-exams once a week over one chapter, which is so much easier to retain than through exams over many chapters. I loved this class and it inspired me to get a supply chain minor."
157,"Prof Bailey is a sweet woman but online isn't her strong suit. The class often had to teach ourselves (this is trig, too). Doesn't teach very well in an online setting."
158,Dr. Ferguson is an amazing prof for CIS163. He really cares that students understand the material and gives a decent amount of help on the projects. This class is a ton of hard work but Ferguson makes it better and is somewhat understanding with grades. His lectures are easy to understand and engaging.
163,Very hard but you learn so much!!
164,"Very smart man, lectures are interesting.  Don't ask him for any help because he won't give you any.  Know EVERYTHING for the tests!!"
165,"Not the worst professor ever, but not necessarily the greatest. Personality-wise, she's sweet and tries her best to connect to students. Her lectures are thorough and explained well. However, she's a VERY strict grader. She'll randomly hand out quizzes or collect homework, so try not to miss class. Take good notes and seek help when needed."
166,"Professor Mays made math very easy to understand, especially for someone that struggles! At the end of every class almost she gives ""quizzes"", but you can work on them with a group of people which helps your grade a lot. She is VERY specific about what will be on exams, including the final, which was SUPER helpful!! Highly recommend!"
168,"Long story short,  AVOID this professor at all costs. Lectures consists of him telling unrelated stories from the 70's and if you're lucky, very brief and vague explanations of class material. Forgets the answers to his questions sometimes. Somehow, I go a good grade thanks to his grading system but I learned NOTHING. "
169,"Professor Buckridge is by far the best professor that i've had at grand valley. His lectures were extremely interesting. He's an amazing professor. His passion for history really shows. If you attend lectures and really listen, the class is super easy. 2 quizzes, 2 exams, 1 paper. not bad at all. take this professor. i promise he's worth it!!!"
170,"Pretty unorganized with syllabus, readings, and general daily lectures. We had a small class, so she definitely noticed if you didn't come or submit something on time. Tries to be helpful, but often made it more confusing. Lectures seemed to be catered to those who had more knowledge on the subject already. Very nice lady, but not a great teacher."
171,"Corey is such a good guy. Honestly, he really cares about his students and he is very intelligent. I learned so much from him and the way I think is completely different after this class. Incredible prof. You have to read a lot in his class. It is not books, but readings online. Tests are 5 multiple choice, one short answer, and three essay."
174,Zeman cares if her students are understanding the material or not. Lectures are not very interesting as she reads off slides but she makes sure everyone understood the concepts. There are in class activities almost every week and she gives a code so you have to attend the lecture. Exams and final was online and honestly not that hard. 
175,"He's a really nice person, and is really smart, but his class was really difficult for me. There was a fair amount of homework and a quiz every week, just make sure you do the homework! The quiz points add up fast, so start off right. His final exam was impossible though."
176,"One of the worst professors I've ever had. Would not recommend taking her because she failed to accommodate student's needs, was degrading, judgmental, and unprofessional in her emails. Overall, she showed poor teaching skills and it was clear she lost her passion to teach and make learning engaging."
177,"Paszek has a great personality, but I wasn't a fan of the class in general. Lectures were kind of pointless; they gave you an idea of the major topics he wanted you to learn, but his exams are chocked full of topics he didn't even mention in-class. Your grade is almost entirely based on the exams, except for one paper. Exams were difficult."
178,Nice guy. Easy class all you have to do is study for the tests. They aren't hard just its an easy class with easy material that you think that you can blow off. He curves grades at the end which is good. Seriously if you study for the tests you'll get an A
182,His teaching style is not effective. Half the exam question are material he does not cover and are very tricky! Many people dropped and many people failed. Its pretty easy to get a B with effort but an A is very hard!I do not recommend him. (He is very nice though)
