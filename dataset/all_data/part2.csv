183,Such a fun lady! Make sure to participate and stay off your phone or you'll be in for a long semester..I'd highly recommend getting on her good side. The tests weren't bad if you studied. The semester long project wasn't bad either-I believe the same as the normal MKT 350 class. I would highly recommend Maria for this class!
184,"Take this review to heart. He is horrible in the sense that he will not teach you about management at all. He gives you every answer for the test so I guess its fairly easy, however, he is a wack-job. Very tough grader on the paper. STAY AWAY FROM HIM AS A PROF. He only teaches what he believes and nothing about management at all. Again, STAY. AWAY"
185,"Loved this prof! Although he never used blackboard and you never knew your grade, as long as you came to class and shared work with your table group you were passing! He definitely knows what he is talking about and has a lot of experience. The lessons we did were fun and useful. I'd take prof Golden again!"
186,"Professor Matchett is an amazing professor. He gives clear explanations and is always willing to help you understand the material. The tests were very tough, but as long as you study and do the weekly readings you'll be fine. Be prepared to work hard for the grade you want. Would definitely recommend taking his class if you can."
187,"I took the honors section and it was a ton of work, but I think that should be expected with an honors class. Super knowledgable lady and she's always there to answer any questions. Exams are tough, but again, in an honors course you should expect that. All in all she was super cool and I really liked her class!"
188,"He keeps class interesting by doing some little fun activities. However, taking notes is hard because he doesn't give a power point,  just and outline. A suggestion I have is to write down every example he gives and evaluate them with the outline."
189,"Actually miserable.  Guy rambles on about god knows what (no religion pun intended), and then expects you to write a paper or take short answer tests and elaborate on extremely vague concepts. Just about everyone in the class is clueless about his expectations. If you're looking for an easy elective and figure this is a good choice think again."
193,"A nice guy, but a TERRIBLE professor. Assigns more assignments than I can count, and tests are EXTREMELY long. Grading criteria is hard to get used to and very specific, but not terrible. He expects almost memorization of the chapter, and his workload is unbelievably high. He does not 'lecture' on material, only answers questions. Do not take him. "
196,"I really enjoyed having Davis! I will admit, sometimes the concepts in his lectures don't immediately click, but he is the most helpful if you go to office hours. I didn't understand how some concepts connected and he spent a hour with me visualizing and reviewing everything before the exam. His exams are not difficult-do the exam review materials."
197,"Her lectures are super boring, and will have you writing until the last minute of class.  She didnt post a study guide for the first test so I bombed it, but once she started posting them for the other 2 I got a BA in the class.  She offered a lot of Extra Credit and the in-class quizzes were easy. I recommend her but bring a pillow to class."
201,"Doc Z. is the best! he is soo funny, he makes boring stuff intersting, he will totally help you out, and his stories are great. You MUST take class with him, hes one of the best profs here!"
202,"Great professor! A bit disorganized, but also willing to go into a direction that the class is interested in going. Provides great exercises for writing and good feedback. Will definitely take more classes with him."
205,"Most laid back prof I have ever had. Tests and quizzes were mainly vocab straight from the book, and if it was anything otherwise, expectations were very clear. The only downside to this class is that there were few chances for points, so doing well on the exams and quizzes was important. Overall is a super cool guy. Even brought his dog in once!"
208,"DG is a great instructor!  He used to be in the Secret Service and it passionate about Criminal Justice and really wants you to understand what he's teaching.  He's funny and tells cool stories about when he was in the Secret Service.  Really fun guy, you should get him if you can!"
210,"LOVED this teacher. He is older so he has stories he likes to tell but he explains the math in such an easy way you don't struggle! NO book needed, it's online. Tests are open book/notes, quizzes can be worked in groups. Easy class but you also learn. I love math now because of this prof!"
211,"DON'T TAKE HIM. In lecture, he just reads the slides word for word. His lectures are so hard to pay attention to because he makes it so boring. When you want to ask him a question he's very rude about it and makes you feel dumb. He expects all of his students to be geniuses. His tests are also very difficult & have mostly written parts."
215,"SUCH AN EASY CLASS. Lets you grade yourself on the final, and on tests. Super laxed. Definitely not the best at teaching but knows his stuff and is super understanding. Just go to class and you'll get at least a B."
216,"Nice Professor.  He makes history interesting.  Great use of media.  Once questions are available on BB for the midterm and final,it is helpful to prepare ahead of time.  He starts posting the questions 2 or 3 weeks before the exam.  You can then paste your answers at exam time."
218,"I'm a Spanish minor and I found this class very fun.  Her stories are hilarious, and if you take good notes and attend most lectures, you will do well. You will not know your grade, but you can guess based on participation and the exams she gives back graded.  She is willing to help after class as well."
220,"Brian genuinely cares about his students. He pushed us to problem-solve rather than simply ""answering"" our questions, and demonstrated tremendous expertise as an English teacher! He gave excellent feedback after observations; critical, but helpful at the same time because his goal was to make me the best teacher possible. Highly Recommended!"
223,"Wonderful teacher. His English is perfectly fine, regardless of what others have said, but he's Korean and he has a Seoul accent.  He's very helpful, replies to emails promptly and will answer all questions you have. Tests are easy if you've done your homework and paid attention.  let you use a sheet of equations on tests."
224,"This lady is no good. She makes things so confusing and doesn't know how to properly teach or grade. She makes the students do work without ever teaching it. Awful. Grading system is terrible, doesn't teach anything so you have no clue what to expect but then she is an incredibly particular grader. Quizzes are bad, from the book without the info."
225,"Professor B was my favorite professor ever. He genuinely cares about his students and helps you actually learn the material and not just memorize it. His teaching style is very interactive and easy to follow along. He always asked if we understood or if we needed him to go back. Literally take him, he is the best. Made calc a 10/10 experience."
227,"Awesome professor! Super energetic and really gets into his lectures, which keeps you interested in what you're learning. He clarifies the material a lot and there's a quiz every week, but they're super easy so just make sure you pay attention and you should do great. Didn't use the textbooks much but you'll need them for some assignments."
228,"Pretty arrogant, always assumes you know nothing about your own project that you've spent the entire semester working on. He really stresses the design process, which is helpful for learning how to take a project from start to finish, but long assignments on that make it hard to actually focus on the project itself, leaving you to cram at the end."
231,"Lockerd is one of the better choices for Honors professors at GV. He has a great sense of humor and does what he can to make his lectures interesting and engaging. He does recognize the amount of work involved in honors and engineering, but that said, he absolutely expects you to read and study - he has little sympathy for slackers."
234,"A horrible man who truly enjoys catching students off guard, calling them out, or trying to make them seem stupid. Very demanding and demeaning. I will say I learned a lot... but I then I could've also learned a lot from someone else who wasn't so mean. Would never take again. Do yourself a favor and avoid if at all possible."
235,Makes labs way longer than they need to be because he wont help you and is not prepared himself.  Assigns enough work for 20 credit hours but you only get 4.  Expects perfection from his students even though his work is shotty.  Avoid him if you can.
236,"Professor Pool is one of kind. She is definitely a master of her profession. She really knows all there is about music and loves passing on her knowledge, love, and enthusiasm of music to her students. Not one day in her class is dull or boring - she always has an upbeat attitude that makes time fly. You will also learn TONS from Prof. Pool!!"
237,"She is honestly one of the best professors I have had at GV. She is so kind and funny, and you can talk to her about anything. She provides amazing feedback on drafts and will do whatever she can to make sure you get the grade you want and worked for. I would definitely take her again if I had the chance!"
238,"Confusing and unclear.  Lectures are scattered.  I often left class confused at what was going on and why.  She seems to be knowledgeable and is passionate about what she is teaching, but ultimately she cannot present it in a clear and understandable manner."
239,"I took Professor Persoon as a freshman and I absolutely loved his class. I looked forward to lectures every week. He encourages creativity alongside analytical thought. The projects were interesting and the essays fairly graded. He was always helpful when I had questions, understanding about absences, and overall encouraged class discussion"
240,Neil is the head of the NRM program so the tests can be hard. You must go to class and pay attention to everything he says for you to do well on his tests. You must study!! He has lots of other grades that will help boost your grade up if you don't do well on his tests. He is a great guy and very helpful when you ask questions.
241,"Rich is a nice guy, but a pretty awful prof.  Hasn't updated his course material since the mid-90's.  Lectures in questions, interrupts students while they are talking, and has vague expectations for projects/assessments.  Easy to get a B, but nearly impossible to get an A.  Take another prof if you can."
242,"She's an amusing woman. The class was not very difficult, contrary to what others might say. She gave the essay questions for the tests in advance, offered lots of opportunities for extra credit and was really enthusiastic about the topics discussed. You have to study the vocab. If you know nothing about politics going in, you'll probably struggle."
244,"Richards is the best prof. Hes super chill and accomodating. He teaches his class in ways that are easy to understand. Very lenient grader. His exams are just like practice quizzes and what he teaches in class, no surprises at all. Ive taken many polisci classes w him and hes the best."
247,"Prof. Estrada is a really nice guy, he tries to crack dry jokes sometimes. However, he has a heavy Columbian accent which makes it kind of tough and boring to focus during lectures. However, he is very intent on teaching his students things that they can put to use in real life, like the night sky and such. Nice guy, just tough to stay awake."
248,"Galen is one of the best professors I've had, lots of dad jokes that keep you engaged. The Content is very easy to understand, I never read the book and did fine. His Exams are word for word from most of his lectures. Its easy, to study for and so much of the quizzes are implied, even if you didn't go to class you can guess and be correct! "
249,"Prof. Reynolds does a good job of keeping things interesting in lecture (does lots of demos, makes jokes, etc.) He teaches the material well but the class is just extremely difficult. Exams are very hard and online homework is harder -I rarely knew what I was doing on the latter. I would definitely recommend Prof. Reynolds for this difficult class."
251,"Scripps isn't a easy teacher. He can be funny and is a genius when it comes to coding, but he doesn't really do a good job teaching it to you. he isn't much help in labs at all either. It's hard at first because I had no programming or coding experience. I learned everything just fine, but mostley by myself with my text book. he's a funny guy tho."
255,"Prof. Lange is great. His lectures are always a blast (even if he does get overly political from time to time) and he enjoys interacting with his students, just don't mention you like Busch. Assignments aren't hard, tests are open note. He's just slow to grade and there's not a ton of assignments, but otherwise, highly recommend this guy.  "
257,"I LOVED Dr. G!! This is a team based learning class, so be sure you work well in groups. A lot of the material you have to teach yourself, but he also goes over the important topics in class and has really good points to make. He gets to know every single student in his class and you can tell that he wants every student to succeed."
259,"Awful prof. Lecture content was outdated and questionable. Terrible at lecturing, would talk super fast and pretty much just read off vague bullet points and never explained anything. Would email her with specific questions and she would give me two word responses that didn't even answer any of my questions. Overall very unhelpful and wouldn't take"
260,"Shes a nice person but her lectures are very boring and kind of hard to follow along. Her examples she gives and whats on tests and quizzes dont match up. If you dont already have a good basic understanding of chem and the math thats used, then take someone else."
262,"Riffe is extremely easy. All you gotta do is come to class and study his cribs and you will pass. He takes attendance by passing back the quizzes and whose ever he gets back, they're marked absent. You take the quizzes on the day he doesn't pass quizzes back so attendance is mandatory. He is boring, but he is the best IME 100 professor to have."
264,He is a very rude professor and expects you to already know the material instead of teaching it properly. His exams are hard and you need to do a lot of independent book studying to pass. If you can avoid taking him then do so!
265,"His lectures may not be the most exciting things in the world, but he explains things fairly well and will treat you as fair as possible.  He has always been consistent; he has 6 quizzes, of which you get to drop two and all of the questions come from the homework.  He will also give out a midterm and a final, which have different questions."
269,"I had Dr. Cole as a prof. and and my college advisor during his time at McKendree College in Lebanon, IL.  He was still completing his PhD at St. Louis U. at the time.  Dr. Cole was tough but extremely helpful and understanding.  I majored in history and thorougly enjoyed all the classes I had with him.  Tough ..... but he really prepared me ."
273,"Prof. Peterman is by far the worst professor I have ever had. She is extremely rude and will respond to you in the shortest, most brief way possible. While she is very knowledgable, lectures are unorganized do little to help students learn.  Homework and labs can be difficult because she expects you to do concepts never covered in class. Avoid her."
274,"This Professor is not my favorite. The reason why is because his teachings are extremely boring and have no enthusiasm what-so-ever. He brags on his background being very egotistic a lot of the times. It's very annoying because he is arrogant for no reason, and we're trying to get there. He knows his material, but have some gaps in teaching it."
