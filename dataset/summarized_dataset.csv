3,"Well... the subject of differentials & linear algebra is hard. That said, he does try to make it as easy as possible by using variation of example problems on the midterms. Sample midterm/ final was just like the real exam. Study, Study, Study. Got by this class by self-learning everything from khan academy and youtube. Textbook is useless
Math 123 can be one of the hardest courses for engineering students at SJSU. Therefore, I believe that Prof. Beeson has done the best he could. I don't know why people keep complaining about partial credit, but I agree with his point of view - If you want to become an engineer, you are not allowed to make mistakes. That's life, deal with it.
Prof. Beeson is extremely apathetic to students, he does not care if you pass or fail. On exams, he does not give any partial credit, which is extremely odd for a math class. Even if you did the problem correct but made a mistake, you lose all your points for one question because Mr. Beeson expects you to be perfect. Strongly do not recommend him
I sleep in class and I still manage to average a B grade for the 3 midterms.
He's so boring and even makes me feel sleepy. I always plays computer games during classes and have to learn the knowledge by myself
2 midterms, 1 final. 10 questions total, and doesn't give partial credit or any extra credit. His voice is very monotone, making it difficult to pay attention. What's worse is trying to understand his handwriting. Half the time, I couldn't read what he wrote because it was so tiny and pretty much chicken scratch. Try to avoid taking him.
Decent professor, knows his material really well but isnt effective in teaching it to other... tests and exams arent too bad they are similar to the sample exams he gives... similar concepts just different problems... quizzes time to time... be prepared to learn the majority of the lectures on your own...
DO NOT take this professor, terrible at speaking and explaining. Tests are only a few questions and a lot of points. Gave one section an easier final than the other, and does not give partial credit.
I took calculus before so the class wasn't as hard however, his tests are only 10 problems usually and each is worth a ton and he doesn't give partial credit usually so you have to exact. No calculators for his class and random quizzes in class from time to time. Hw is easy all done on an online program no effort, will you learn calculus, maybe.
This proffesor is a total joke, avoid him at all costs. He manages to take a not too challenging subject into something impossible.
Pros:clear plans for the whole semester, course plan and grading standards are good, software is good, never late or absent, a knowledgable professor.        Cons:he is always explaining but not teaching, need to go learn in the book by yourself; examples are modification of tests but terrible handwriting so hard to understand, really boring class.
Beeson is one the first professors that I had at SJSU. He lives and breathes the CLRS book. His lectures are very clear, but the projects, which account for 50% of the grade are difficult, so work on them early. Tests were easy and open book. Come to lecture and take notes!
He analyzes everything you say like a bad shrink. The other commenter wasn't kidding when they said he stops for minutes at a time to contemplate the next step. Heard of planning? No calculators, which would be fine except that some test questions are ridiculous without one (eg. plug 5/4 into 4x^3+15x^2+12x+6. Actual step in a final exam Q)
Because he spent several years creating his math software, he believes it's the ultimate teacher when teaching calculus.  He's apathetic to students, expects so much from them. Very unclear, boring. I've never had a math prof. who pauses for days thinking what's the next step to take in a math problem.
Smart and very nice teacher. Good teach style. Lector is organized. Know how to teach student. know how to separate the section and assignment, then student could learn step by step. Not push too much. You need to read the book before listen the lecture. Learn a lot from the course. Very useful course overall.
Very hard homework but easy tests.  If you listen to the lectures and attend class you will do great, reading the book is mostly optional.
He's a damn good professor but he can be a bit of a jerk sometimes.  I was in the section where he yelled at the whole class for 30 minutes because half of the people in both sections failed the 2nd midterm.  Just keep up with the lecture notes, study before midterms, and do all the HW.  You should do just fine.
Beeson is one of the best teachers I've had at this school.  It's a hard class, but he explains things well. I've never met a teacher that was as willing to help students as this guy.  He'll take a later bus home to santa cruz if people still need help!  Don't take this class with any other teacher. Trust me.
Beeson is a hardass when it comes to grading but if you prepare for his class every day you will benefit. He  cares about you coming to class and doing all the daily problems, you will come out of this class ready to produce industry level code. He seems to care deeply about the quality of engineers sjsu pumps out, that is you, better study!
He's a little nuts but he's very smart and is really interested in the subject of CS146.  I'd strongly recommend him for that class.","Pros:clear plans for the whole semester, course plan and grading standards are good, software is good, never late or absent, a knowledgable professor.

15,"I'm a math major and my GPA was solid 3.5+. but after taking one class with him.. ughhhh no. just no. please no. my first time failing class in my whole life.
Had a horrible time in this class and Im good at math. He discourages using calculators or formulas, is terrible at lecturing, and doesnt put any grades in Canvas.
He's horrible, take him at your own risk. I'm taking him online and have been struggling in his class. He refuses to record online lectures. He barely grades any assignments throughout the whole semester until the end. His exams are nothing like the homework and gives no study guides or practice test questions. He uses proctorio for tests.
Don't take him for any math classes unless you are a math genius. His midterms and final were ridiculously harder than the homework, and he never went over the concepts behind the exam problems before the exams. He doesn't even curve the exams even if they are below the class average. The majority failed in his classes. Avoid him at all costs!
He's a pretty good professor as long as you go to class. Most of the problems on exams will be the ones he does in class, so go to class. He will often say if he asks this on exams this is how to do it and then he'll show the work. Three exams total, two midterms and a final. The homework isn't too helpful so don't expect those on exams.
Overall, a manageable class with a relatively difficult subject matter. Most of the tests are questions and examples he mentions in class so it is important that you attend and pay attention to all of his lectures. Homework seemed like busy work since the problems were way harder than ones in class and were not on the tests at all.
Look for practice midterms for his class. They are pretty similar to his real exams. Also, even though he primarily presents through PPT, really understand the definitions and underlying proofs/probs he writes. If you don't understand them, either ask people around you or a tutor after class. Understanding each definition and proof is key for exam!
If you have the opportunity to take discrete math with another instructor or to a community college, do so. His teaching style is heavy on his slides which relates NOTHING to the homework. His homework DOES NOT reflect what he teaches in class. I ended up learning discrete math from a YouTuber. This was a waste of time and money.
Barely any curve, just recites text directly from textbook, and does NOT put any grades online through the grading portal or use it at all for that matter.
His lectures are based off of slides, which aren't the best to learn from due to them being blobs of text. He goes way too fast as well, sometimes skipping topics or barely explaining them. Homework doesn't seem to help much on exams. Does give sample of old exam for the first exam, though.
Super hard, first midterm was somewhat by the books but second midterm and final was terrible. Homework did not help at all
Super hard! Homework is not relevant to exam material and he actually gets annoyed if you go to clarify things during office hours. You're better off self-studying and using Slader to solve your problems. Avoid!
He doesn't explain things very well and isn't the most friendly. When you dont understand something he seems offended and acts like you weren't paying attention and thats why you dont understand. Somewhat condescending. He is very distant from his students and isnt the type that will learn the names of his students. Very impersonal & bad at teachin
Easily the worst professor I've had. Doesnt explain things well, just monologues without making much sense. Class is dependent on doing well on the 3 tests, with homework barely making any contribution to your grade. Teaches straight out of powerpoint, rarely taking time to do problems on the board. Youtube is more helpful than going to class
He mostly reads off of his powerpoint, but the slides explain stuff pretty decently. He is always open to questions & is accessible outside class. There's two midterms and a final, which were all pretty easy. He also puts up homework every week, but gives you about 4-5 days to work on it. Overall, he's a very nice person and does his best to help.
I eventually stopped going to class because his lectures were awful and just read the book. The material is very interesting, but Kubelka ruins it by reading off a ""wall of text"" powerpoint derived from the book. He rarely ""teaches"" because he lacks the intuition and clarity to do so effectively. His online homework is a mess of errors.
By far one of the worst math professors ever, this is my second math course at SJSU and he was one of the worst professors ever. He is not clear when explaining the lessons, all he does is read off the power point. If you don't know how to do proofs or haven't learned them since the prerequisites for this class is precalc do not take him.
Kubelka might be the worst professor that I have had at sjsu. I have found that watching a 5-10 minute youtube video is often more helpful that his lectures. He teaches straight from powerpoint, occasionally writing some stuff on the board. His tests are nothing like the homework. Tests are proof based and the homework is more calculations based.
He was one of the most helpful professors I had all of last year, and taught a really hard subject. Most of his examples were interesting, making it easier, and he was fairly funny in general. The tests were fairly hard, but that didnt make too much of a difference after all the help he gave. Especially after going to his office hours.
Gives hw where you actually do math, however, midterms were not like that. You mostly answer why and how something is the way it is. Did not expect this on the first midterm which dug me into a deep hole.","Kubelka might be the worst professor that I have had at sjsu.

18,"Ty Lin seems like a great guy. Love his classes, always looking forward to them , because he is so nice and motivating.
I've never been more confused in all my school years. He is very disorganized. Teaches a topic at the end that is not available online, in textbooks or even through adequate in-class materials. I've never seen the whole class so confused and disappointed in a teacher. You've been warned.
Not a good choice. Difficult to understand his english. Random lecture topics. Seemed unorganised and chaotic. However you dont have much of a choice with his subject.
Database is an important class, so please don't waste yours on him.
Adamant, vague, confusing. In the two lectures I stayed for, Lin was very insistent that we all have Visual Studio (even if it meant installing another OS). He threatened to drop anyone who couldn't get it, despite there being more viable alternatives to VS. The advice he gives is questionable; he told me the C# template I had was fine (it wasn't).
Horrible teacher. Barely lectures during class time, and continually talks about his project his students have contributed to over the years. It's nearly impossible to understand what he is saying; he doesn't clarify details at all. Gives sporadic quizzes 5 minutes after an unclear lecture. Probably the worst class I've taken in my life. AVOID HIM.
It is really easy class. If you get lower than B+, then you might need to switch Major. Class topic can be helpful for your study but lecture is NOT useful
Absolutely and unequivocally the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. You will learn very little to nothing from him and what he expects on assignments and tests is unclear. His communication skills, both written and verbal, are almost nonexistent. The class was a very long and stressful way to learn a little SQL from a textbook.
Worst professor on earth. Harasses mentally. NOT fair with grading. Calls on weekends, holidays. His moto is to torture students
Terrible teacher. Lectures are slow and repetitive. Course breadth is extremely narrow. He does not speak good English. He cannot see well enough to read read and makes constant typos. Homework assignments are poorly given without full explanation of grading criteria. He gives free grades increases and extra credit for helping him outside of class.
Worst professor I have ever had. Horrible lectures and repeats the same lectures over and over. Barely taught anything and never used the book. Tried to defend his poor teaching by showing student evaluations from 10 years ago and then bash the rest of the teachers as SJSU for not publishing as much as him.
Don't ever take his subject. He is horrible, he takes tests but never grades them. U don't have to work in his subject and u learn nothing.
Bad lecturer. Disorganized. Learned very little about assembly. Stayed on one topic for the entire semester. Keeps poor records of grades.
He's a great programmer but a pretty bad professor. He's useless unless you can understand what he's trying to say. His teaching style can be described as authoritarian. Look, if you understand him and truly care about the subject, you'll learn quite a lot. Otherwise, avoid.
Worst professor i have ever seen. i don't understand what is he doing in San Jose State? Waste of time and money. Don't take this class unless you have to. Grades are easy to get, but you won't learn anything. Not a single word ! He doesn't even know what he is teaching. He neither understand nor speak proper English.. Avoid it guys....
Absolutely the worst instructor I have ever had. His lectures are unorganized, unclear, and repetitive. Taking his class was a waste of my time and money. Save yourself the trouble and avoid him at all costs. Lin should not be given the right to retire; he should be fired as soon as possible.
The worst teacher. I got an A in the course, so I am not bitter. Previous reviews are true. A third exam a week before the final is proof of his disorganization. Waited until the final day to inform us that only the top 10% (out of 25 students) will receive A's regardless of overall %. The head of CS has received many complaints about Lin.
He really likes to talk about himself. He lectures about the same thing for a few weeks, which you don't learn anything new in the class. He does not have a set schedule, grading policy, or midterm schedule, so expect to take random quizes and midterms. Not recommended. He knows his stuff, but doesn't know how to lecture.
Do not take this teacher. First of all he only speaks about himself most of the class time. Then he spents all other time giving quiz which he didn't teach. No only that, he doesn't give answers to the exams or quizzes if asked in the class. In many occastions he ignores student questions and not answer them throughout the class. He prefers you to
Sloppy, careless, and utterly incomprehensible. Also a hypocrite. Squawks about students not having the ""right attitude"" or not putting in enough effort, but puts in zero to no effort into teaching the class! He wore pajama pants under his jeans once. What a lazy professor! His tests and notes look like they were typed by retarded monkeys. AVOID!!!",Terrible teacher. Lectures are slow and repetitive. Course breadth is extremely narrow. He does not speak good English. He cannot see well enough to read read and makes constant typos. Homework assignments are poorly given without full explanation of grading criteria.

29,"love this guy
Great person, but not the best teacher. He puts lots of emphasis on critical topics for the exams which was helpful, but does not stay on topic during lectures all the time and relies too much on group projects for homework.
Great Professor! Would take him again. He is super caring and has a loving and warm attitude, which makes class easy to go to. Take him if you can. Class is paper heavy there are no tests. Gives good instruction on papers though.
Professor Key is awesome! For this introductory honors seminar, he does an amazing job with class discussions and making the lectures student lead instead of professor led. He gives great feedback on papers, so if papers are not your thing he will help you write them well. He is very good at making time outside of class for students.
Get ready for tons of lectures and notes. As long as you pay attention you'll pass. Has extra credit assignments here and there, but he's very passionate about the subject and expects you to discuss the topics.
Great guy, but the class was a bit of a headache. He lectured a lot, and ended up basically yelling trying to be 'passionate.' there is lots of group work, and the tests are very difficult to prepare for. I would love to speak to him outside of class, but I just didn't enjoy how he taught.
I'd 10/10 be friends with him outside of class but do not take his class. Way too difficult for the level of the class and his tests do not reflect your understanding of the content 0/10.
I'll preface this by saying I'm a lazy student who doesn't like applying myself. This class requires you to do the reading and really think in order to excel. That being said, I loved the class so much, I changed my major. Dr. Key is the best college professor I've ever had. If you have a chance to learn from him, do it. Right now.
 This is the hardest class i have ever taken. A lot of work and reading to prepare for tests. The tests are long and you only have the class time to finish. 
If there is another professor for this course take him (or her). He only explains subjects in ways that he can understand but leaves the rest of the class confused. He answers questions harshly and is not the friendliest guy. He weights his tests a lot so if you do poorly on one test it will really affect your grade. Tests are extremely difficult.
Honestly, one of the best professors I have ever had. Fantastic at doing his job! However, it is one of the hardest classes I have ever had as well. No way I would be able to make it out alive without Professor Key! 
Dr. Key is an amazing teacher with a true passion for Philosophy. His class is really hard, so constantly keep up with the work load.
Fantastic professor. VERY hard class but you will learn a ton. He is a funny guy who loves the Lord, knows what he is talking about, and is extremely helpful if approached outside of class. One of the most intelligent people I have ever met.
Assigns wayyyyy too much reading for very little quiz and test questions.
Not will to help you understand information. Rushes through lecture and expects you to learn information not cover in class on your own. Tell student that they should not be working if they are taking his class
He's tough because his courses require you to keep up in the reading and then synthesize it into writing of some sort, but he is extremely encouraging and wise. a truly great prof.
Dude, Key is tough but he is funny and if you stay with him you'll definitely learn a lot.
Professor Key is my favorite professor at CBU so far! He is challenging but it is worth it. He makes the topic of philosophy interesting and relevant. He is very helpful with any questions. I loved taking his class and hope to have him as a professor again.
Definitely one of the hardest professors! If you like philosophy go for it. If you are not ready to be challenged and work really really hard don't even bother. He knows a lot about the subject and he's passionate about it. Have fun!
Fun guy, you will learn so much you won't know what to do with some of it. IT WILL INCORPORATE INTO YOUR LIFE. His class is difficult for the fact that he wants you to type a  one to three page summary of the text you read depending on what it is, and if you don't understand the philosopher this class is not for you.","Great Professor! Would take him again. He is super caring and has a loving and warm attitude, which makes class easy to go to. Take him if you can. Class is paper heavy there are no tests. Gives good instruction on papers though."
45,"I think everyone is being dramatic. He is kinda creepy and his analogies can be super weird, but that's life. It's a lot of work for a 0 credit hr class that is doable if you manage your time.I can see where he's coming from usually... his delivery on concepts can just be off-putting. I wouldn't take him again but it wasn't the end of the world. 
If you can get ahead on all of your homework, you will be fine. Yes, there are assignments due before every class but they're like 5-10 question assignments based on super short chapters in his book. It's tedious and annoying, but the class is required. You'll be okay if you are organized and can stay ahead. 
Absolutely horrible 
He makes a zero credit course more work than all the other classes you have combined. He makes the students study and read out of a book that he wrote. 
He is a better professor than others would indicate.  He cares about students and wants to make a positive impact in their lives.  I only have two issues: there is too much homework and studying for a 0-credit class and the concepts may (only sometimes) be a bit simplistic and specific only to certain situations.  Overall, he is a good professor.
Professor Lash honestly cares about all of his students. His class helped me find ways to flee anxiety and other common pitfalls of Christians. Many people take this class for granted and forget that it is part of a scholarship they receive at DBU, so I would recommend listening to his advice on gratitude and selflessness.
Covered way more zoology than Christian Leadership. Useless, but you have to take the class.  Take the spiritual concepts he presents with a grain of salt. Do all the homework, and pay attention to the extra credit and you will be fine.  More about your ability to reiterate his opinions, then you having an actual opinion. 
Horrible theology and has incorrect views when it comes to biology and psychology. 
Lash, I'm sure is a nice guy, but he is leading people astray. The book This Was Your Life! has the worst theology in the world. It's about them having visions and meeting God and that you have to be good people in order to earn his favor. WRONG and I'm tired of the deceit. Be warned and be on guard. Know your Bible. His word is not The Word.
I will say that this class is what made me an atheist. Assignments are easy though, and he can be funny.
I do not agree with his theology which made it hard to take away anything from this class. Easy assignments but too many for zero credit hours. He is passionate about what he teaches, I'll give him that. I hope that DBU actually reads through their course evaluations because I think there should be more options for who teaches this class.
only professor offered for this course he has strange quirks overall class is biblical because its for a Christian scholarship so his approach to different topics is going to be focused on spiritual life many do not like the way he talks about mental health but I feel like yes there are other factors but that's not what the class is about
Professor Lash not only espouses questionable theology, but also expects far too much of students for a class that is worth zero credits. The class is easy enough but the tests are made up of random arbitrary information that he mentions in the lectures. Covers about 10 minutes worth of material over the hour long class.
Doesn't know what he is talking about. Said that if you struggle with depression or anxiety then you don't have enough faith. Probably should take a psych class or two if he's gonna talk like that.
DON'T TAKE HIM
My issue with this professor was the lack of care he had for how what he said effected his students. He was very derogatory when talking about mental health. I truly wish there were other options for professors with this class. I want whoever taking this to be mentally prepared for lots of cruel statements.
Jamie lash is one of the most intelligent professors Ive ever had. Since Ive been in his class, Ive experienced freedom from things I didnt even know were holding me back. If you take the time to listen to him, you will get so much from him and gain wisdom and insight that will change your life!!
Jamie Lash stands out as one of my most memorable and appreciated teachers, not for the subject of FINANCE, that I took under him, but because he sees much further and more deeply than the short-term benefits of these details. He is thinking and looking eternally, at each students salvation and encouraging a life walked in Jesus Christ's footsteps.
Dr. Lash is not as bad as everyone says. I definitely made the mistake of showing up the first day of class with a closed mindset based off of everyone else's opinions of him. He really is a very nice man. Just take everything he says with a grain of salt. Show up, listen to the lectures, TAKE NOTES (answers to tests), pass the class. Done.
Lash is not as bad as people make him out to be. He can seem like a know it all at times, but he definitely has his students' best interest in mind and does everything he can to help you pass. The homework can be very specific to the textbook and the grading can be nitpicky but I didn't hate the class by any means.","He is a better professor than others would indicate.

47,"AMAZING
Good guy, makes lectures interesting but they can get confusing so you need to pay attention. Tests come straight off the homework, as long as you take a look at the assignments before the test you'll have no problem. Highly recommend.
John Swain gets it.  He presents physics in a fun, upbeat way that makes non-physics college students enjoy it.  He's a character and he's lectures are entertaining.  If you try a little bit you'll get an A.  I appreciate physics more bc he didn't shove it down my throat, he made it fun.  
Really great instructor. If you study from the problem sets and take good notes you are sure to pass.
Great Professor: kind, understanding, need to know the basics but no trick questions. Makes the material easy to understand. Very fair and promotes real life work like collaboration 
My favorite professor I've had so far! He had such enthusiasm and made a lot of things that could have been boring very interesting. He could be a bit confusing at times, but always went back to go over things we weren't clear on. His exams were very fair and easy as long as you study from the problem sets he provided. Awesome guy, learned a lot.
Professor Swain is the best teacher I've had at Northeastern. Ridiculously knowledgeable, hilarious, and very helpful. Lectures go off on tangents but they are always interesting, and if you don't understand something in the lecture he will gladly meet you anytime to help you. Loves the subject and genuinely wants his students to learn and do well.
A really fantastic person who wants his students to not only do well but also enjoy the subject matter. caution: he mixes a very divergent mindset with occasional convergence to the main ideas and some analysis. If you haven't learned where to pay attention and take notes, you will only be catching about half of the information presented in class.
fun guy, class easy to get through, very smart but terrible class if you want to learn physics-had to have someone else teach me the material-he says dont worry about your grade he'll curve but his curve brought my grade down so be careful
Very entertaining professor. He tells great stories and keeps you awake in class for the most part. Unfortunately, his teaching method is not all that effective and the tests can be hard if you didnt understand the material. Gives very generous curves tho.
Halarious guy, it's more of a physics class than astronomy though, His tests are kinda hard, he says he tries to make them easy, but he's kinda off the deep end, He means well and wil help you, and i only went to class like 6 times all semester and did well, plus he's the most entertaining person in the world.
He's zany and spontaneous, like a mad scientist, and usually has good stories, so it's fun to watch. He's not an effective teacher, unfortunately. His lectures are very hard to follow. The tests are pretty tricky, but he gives you a very generous curve. Do not take this course if you want to actually LEARN physics.
He is a nice guy and pretty strange. He says that he doesn't try to trick you but then has tests with a bunch of tricky questions. He wasn't there for either of the review sessions and I felt really unprepared for the tests. Still, a really easy class that you don't really have to go to, and believe me a lot of people skip.
Swain is AMAZING.  he's energetic, fun, and knows what he's talking about.  He's a great teacher, doesn't use notes, tells funny/interesting stories, and you'd have to be a total sped to fail the class.  no homework. attendence isn't manditory, and he gives you take home final/midterms.
He is INSANE (but in a good way)...take his class if you like to laugh.  He throws chalk, electrocutes himself, ad does lots of other crazy things.  He makes class interesting (though he doesn't talk about much astronomy...it's mostly physics).  He doesn't make us do calculations though.  Also, he stops teaching after about 45 minutes of class time
Astronomy.  Great lecture class.  Everyone shows up to class every day because he's such a good teacher.  4 multiple choice tests and throws away the worst.  It is very hard to dose off in this class.  He has so much energy, tells great stories relating to the class, and does fun experiments and stuff.
great prof.way entertaining & really wants u to understand physics from a different perspective than you've probably ever been taught before. he goes a little slow but asks for class feedback on how ""slow"" he's going.. ppl just let him continue for the most part. he is probably one of the smartest guys ive ever but most impt he wants u to do well.
Haha great guy, it prob **** for class every day, wears black shirts every day cuz he knows hes going to spill coffee on it and doesnt want it to be noticable. Not a particularly great teacher, kinda confusing, but he really wants everyone to do well so he scales everything and basically gives points away.
Great elective, easy class, great teacher, dont even need the book
Swain is a great professor. While the subject was boring, his off-topic ramblings were great. His classes are definately worth taking.","My favorite professor I've had so far!

48,"She is nice at giving feedback but there's a plethora of papers and homework passed around every day.
Not the biggest fan. Hard to do well and shes very rude. Would not recccomend.
She was so bad, I wanted to give her a zero. But that's not possible. So, I give her a 1.
Class was extremely boring and she gets specific on her tests when there is a lot of information. I took it over winter session and found it harder than what people led it on to be.
If you do any mass comm  research, you'll find her name everywhere. She knows her stuff and is so nice and helpful. her media message analysis class is easy and interesting. another cool comm professor
Nancy is the most lovable and kindhearted professor in the Comm department!
take research with her winter session if you need it for Comm. total easy A
I don't understand why she has such bad ratings. I just finished taking research methods with her over winter sesh and easily got an A. the tests are crystal clear and follow the notes/book exactly. I recommend taking research methods over winter session with her for  any CommI major. Shes also a nice person and willing to answer any questions
I took her online class COMM251 ""communicating effectively""... easiest online class I've ever taken! it only took me one day to go through the online required readings/assignments; if you have any questions/concerns she gets back to you through email very fast; best class possible for 1-credit elective
Not the best I've ever had, I'll say this much: If your complaint is that you couldn't squeeze a C+ out of her instead of a C, you've got bigger problems in college than this professor.
Excellent Prof, Had her for Media Message Analysis AND Research Methods in 2003-04. She is tough and she knows her stuff-and expects you to take part in your learning (no spoon feeding).  I'm a grad student now and I owe alot of my success NOW to the level of work I put into her classes THEN.  Serious Comm majors will benefit from her classes.
zzz...what, did i just sleep through the class? dont try to make it through an hour 15 with this prof. Not unbelieveable hard and actually quite accomplished in the field but it wouldnt seem like it. Pray for the days when she plays videos to avoid her lectures. also i dont care about your dogs lady!
this class isnt hard, it just goes by slowly. Some of the material is kinda interesting but overall its boring. Shes a nice lady but she reads straight from the notes, so if you miss class you wont miss much.
Avoid at all costs. She reads the slides she projects word for word. Don't count on her to explain/clarify anything. She'll just repeat the same thing again, using the term/word you're unsure of in the definition. Be prepared to teach yourself. Its time for her to retire because she obviously puts no effort into teaching nor cares about students.
Class wasn't at all what I thought it was going to be but it isn't bad.  The whole class is based around a content analysis.  If you are interested in research, this is the class for you.  She was very helpful with the whole thing.
Oh Signorielli...I didn't go to class because she read from powerpoint that I had bought that she publishes.  She literally reads it from the slide.  Just read her notes, skim the book, don't ask questions, but try to avoid her.
Children & the Mass Media was interesting and pretty easy.  She always answered all our questions and wanted our input.  I think she is a good professor.
Terrible.  Like the most of the Comm classes they take easy information and try to make it more complicated to justify their jobs.  Tons of worthless information and boring stories about her family, what a zero she is
This class was soooo boring it convinced me that I had ADD. If you want to hear about her husband, children, and boring life, take this class. If you want to learn things about communication take someone elses class.","this class isnt hard, it just goes by slowly. Some of the material is kinda interesting but overall its boring. Shes a nice lady but she reads straight from the notes, so if you miss class you wont miss much."
57,"she is a definition that cares a lot about students
She is so sweet. Take her.13 maybe 14 quizzes and she drops the lowest 3 or 4.Two test and a final.3 papers. Just read the required readings and and you will get an A.
Dr. Frederick's class reminded me of pleasant story times when I was younger. Be prepared to read and to be quizzed on your readings. (Spark notes helped me  when I was feeling lazy). The books chosen were great and the essay topics were worth writing on. I highly recommend her class to any English majors.
She's a sweetheart and knows her stuff. But be ready to READ! Her 3 exams aren't too bad, just do the reading.
If it goes on the board it goes on the test.  Expect to do a lot of reading.  You have to work in this class, but she is very sweet and can be forgiving if you do.  If you don't do the reading her tests/quizzes will consume your soul. She is old fashioned, but that's not surprising considering she may have dated Thoreau in high school. I loved her.
Absolute sweetheart! She really loves/cares about her students, and knows why literature is important.  Two 10 page papers, a midterm, and a final.  Good reading, she connects it with your life and past historical events. GREAT ENGLISH TEACHER, and GREAT PROFESSOR OVERALL.  I LOVE HER!
Good prof, a lot of reading that can it very tedidious, but that's a english class for you...she makes it fun though, and really tries to give you a good grade fairly...i love her to death, somedays the class gets on my nerves, but then again, we all have those days
SO MUCH READING. The text book has Bible-thin pages, so reading takes forever. Don't read in bed; you'll fall asleep. Gives hints about when you'll have a quiz. 3 tests not cummulative. over 10 quizes, but she only keeps your top 10 grades. 3 papers. Boring material, but she knows her stuff. She's a good teacher; the material is just boring.
I've taken classes with Prof. Frederick twice already and would definitely take a class with her again.  She is very knowledgeable and is very passionate about what she teaches.  I don't know if I would have enjoyed Moby Dick as much without her enthusiasm and passion.  She is helpful, sweet, and funny.  A great teacher and a nice person.
I love her.  She is always willing to help and can be very witty and clever in class.  She is my favorite professor because of her kindness and caring nature.  There were two 10 page papers, two tests, and about 15 reading quizzes for the semester.  Ask her for help on the papers and just do your reading for the tests/quizzes -you'll be fine!
It's an alright class depending on how into early american literature you are. It is too much work for a gened though. On average an hour and a half of reading and half an hour for a lit response. As long as you do everything you'll get  a decent grade though.
Fairly easy grader, does not give extensions but will work with you individually if you come to her office hours before something is due.  Lectures are usually pretty boring and she sometimes assigns a lot of reading (there were a few nights we had to read over 100 pages, but the average was around 40-50 a night), but she is a very nice lady!
LOVE this lady, she's so nice and helpful. Her lectures are interesting - she really knows what she's talking about. There is a lot of reading, but it pays off. Exams aren't cumulative, and she gives you a lot of time/help on the papers. She's awesome.
adorable, and knows her stuff too. She helped me so much with my writing ability taking a lot of one-on-one time to read over what i had written. definatly take her if you love to read and want to improve your writing
Unwieldy amount of reading if you have a lot of other classes to read for...  nice, but very dry lectures.  Attendance policy.
First of all, the reading isn't that much at all. She's very intelligent and really knows her stuff. yes there is nightly reading--but it's a literature class!! people who complain about it are just lazy, she's an awesome teacher!
she was adorable. had her 10 years ago, pretty good class, she once said ""i am not trying to diss you guys, but the test is postponed until next week"" it was funny,y ou had to be there
Dr. Frederick is very nice and she knows a lot about American Literature.  However, she assigns a ton of reading and there are one or two quizzes on the reading every week.  2 eight page papers (one research) and 2 exams.  Her lectures can get somewhat boring, but she tries hard to make things fun
Nice lady, but class lectures are boring.  There is lots of reading, and several pop quizzes, but as long as you skim, you'll do fine.  3 tests and 3 papers.  You can get an easy B without too much effort.","Absolute sweetheart! She really loves/cares about her students, and knows why literature is important.  Two 10 page papers, a midterm, and a final.

58,"Dr Johnson is amazing. I know way more about CS Lewis than I ever wanted but he made the class as easy as possible. Reading quiz every class but they're easy questions and you grade it yourself; at the very least sparknote it and you'll do okay. Gives random points out, but 2 big papers he grades pretty tough on. Weird but easy and enjoyable GenEd
Johnson is the sweetest! He really cares about his students, whether that means success in his class or outside it. Some people in my class complained that they couldn't follow what he was saying, but they can't expect to vibe well with every professor they meet. Johnson really does his best to make grammar as easy to digest as possible! Take him!!
a great professor who genuinely cares about his students and trusts them. he is a personable guy and respects everyone's opinions. attendance isn't taken but there are quizzes each class. even though I was allowed two skips I didn't take any because I actually wanted to be in class.
I really liked Dr. Johnson! He chooses interesting pieces for reading material, and you have discussions in class. There were 3 papers and a midterm and final, and quizzes almost every class. It may sound daunting, but it really isn't once you get into the swing of things! I would definitely take this class again!
Professor Johnson is like if a smile was a person. I'm not a massive fan of grammar, but he made it fun, useful, and easy. I love this man with my entire soul
He is the sweetest. He really wants to help you. He teaches at the pace the class can handle which I really appreciated. If we were not ready to be quizzed on a topic, he would wait until he felt like we were ready. You have to do the homework and put in the effort. If you want to do the minimal amount of work, this is not the class for you.
He gives at least 1-2 quizzes per class and then you switch quizzes with a partner and grade them. And then, he goes down the attendance list and everyone reads their grade-not good. and this happens-every single class.
Johnson is really cool. I had my doubts about this class but he makes it a lot of fun. Expect lots of class discussions with very few actual lectures. There are three papers, a midterm, a final, and some quizzes spread throughout the semester. The papers aren't that hard and he gives you clear instructions. Would take again.
Johnson is the man! Love his class. His is so nice and super helpful when it comes to giving feedback. He wants you to be successful & states exactly what he expects from you. lets you venture your own path when it comes to the writing assignments (theres 3). There are daily quizzes in this class but if you do the readings, they arent hard at all.
Definitely suggest taking him. Interesting readings, great lectures, funny guy. He can be a bit of a tough grader on papers, but it will only make you better, and he's totally willing to work with you. Great class, awesome professor!
One of the sweetest professors. I took his 299 class last year and am currently enrolled in his Grammar 309 course this semester. He's not the easiest professor, he expects a lot of self-learning out of his students and quizzes heavily. Although, he is incredibly flexible and willing to help through office hours! Highly recommended! 
Bruce is amazing! I took his Eng 299 class and loved it. He makes a lot of quizzes and his answers are pretty specific, so make sure to read. Before a paper is due, go to his office hours. He is really helpful and it will likely boost your grade for the paper. Several opportunities for extra credit. 
I LOVE BRUCE.  Such a cool guy and one of the BEST english profs I have ever had.  I read the assinged books and worked hard on the papers but i loved it!  I had more fun and learned more in his class than several classes combined.  TAKE Bruce but be prepared to write thorogh papers
I LOVE BRUCE! He's a really funny and just nice guy.  Super helpful and always willing to answer questions (even if that means going way off-topic).  I'm definitely going to take him again.  Work load isn't too bad as long as you keep up with the readings for the mini quizzes in class.
Johnson is really intelligent and interesting. I really enjoyed this class even though, i'm usually more of a science person. TAKE HIM! He really isn't that bad. The only reason I got a very high B is because I screwed up the midterm b/c of mono. One of the best profs at JMU i've had so far.
Very nice man. Most of the class time consisted of discussions about the material read the night before. He will call on random people to participate in the discussions. His tests are hard but the papers were not too bad (you have 3 of them). Lectures can be confusing and hard to follow but otherwise good professor
Can't say enough good things about him. Interesting reading material, interesting discussion, & he is very knowledgeable but not unapproachable at all. When you turn in final drafts of papers he lets you get peer edits & then change things on the paper you turn in at the last minute, it's very helpful. You will learn a lot & feel motivated by him.
Bruce Johnson is the best teacher I have ever had. He really wants you to do well in the class. Go to class every day because there are daily quizzes on the readings assigned. There are 3 papers which are definitely challenging so don't leave them until the last minute. Great class, Johnson is funny and knows what hes talking about.
This has been my favorite professor so far at JMU. Really nice and cool guy. It does require reading almost every night and small quizzes on the reading that are graded by ur classmates. If you are willing to do the reading, you can come out with an A in this class.
The class was titled ""17th Century British Poetry"" & should have been titled ""17th Century British History"" Although he is a nice guy & a good teacher, he was not good at teaching this class. We rarely discussed the poems and the paper assignments were unreasonable and vague. My advice, take Johnson but a different class that he teaches.",a great professor who genuinely cares about his students and trusts them. he is a personable guy and respects everyone's opinions. attendance isn't taken but there are quizzes each class. even though I was allowed two skips I didn't take any because I actually wanted to be in class.
73,"The lecture was completely useless so I stopped going. The tests were very easy and often just taken from the past exams that he gives you. The labs are horrible and so hard but that's not his fault. He started giving codes in class that you have to type into canvas to show you were at lecture which sucked. Homeworks on webassign was very nice.
He is the worst professor I've had so far at the university. Says he'll give partial credit but never does. There were two exams and the final. The average for the first exams was in the mid 50s and the average for the second was a 46. After failing the class, he'll tell you it was a simple exam. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! Wish I could give a 0 rating.
Xiao is one of the most harsh graders at the university. His slides for lecture always have errors, so students are studying wrong information. He does not curve exams at all, even when the class averages are in the 50s and 40s. Grading on exams is unfair, since he takes off a ridiculous amount of points for the smallest mistake. Steer clear.
Worst professors I have taken at this university. Homework's do not align with what we learn in lecture (learn nothing in lecture). Quizzes are homework questions with partial credit awarded. Exams are homework questions in which no partial credit is awarded. Class exam average in 40's no curve. An embarrassing professor for the department to have.
Can I rate any lower than a 1? His slides are a disaster. He constantly makes mistakes on them and doesn't fix it so we end up studying the wrong answer. He doesn't give any partial credit on his exams. His grading is all over the place. The entire class failed the exams and he said it was us not him. He expects his test average to be 54%. RUN AWAY
Just don't take Xiao's class. The average on the first exam was a 57 and the second exam was a 46. Both exams were not curved. His lectures are beyond boring and completely useless as he just points his laser pointer at the slides that are full of mistakes (which he won't fix). If you don't have to take his class, don't; and if you do, I'm sorry.
Xiao isn't a bad prof, but you will have to work at it. He gives minute papers so you can directly ask questions and get 5% of your grade just for paying attention. Labs are miserable but I think that's more of the department's problem. He re-uses old test problems and examples from class so if you do his practice exams you'll be fine.
This is the only class where I've sat down and actually put work into an assignment and still gotten a 0 on it. Lectures & labs are a waste of time but are mandatory. He goes on lecture long tangents about applications, but when it comes to the problems you'll be tested on he just says ""it's a very simple equation, very easy to solve"" then goes on
Worst professor ever. Not approachable. Condescending.
This class was extremely difficult.  I never skipped class, but I still felt as though I was missing something no matter how hard I studied.  Nothing made sense.  He's a really nice guy and curves generously, and he gives extra credit for coming to class and turning in a minute paper.  He encourages people to go to office hours too.
Lecture left me more confused, so I stopped going. The discussion TA was EXTREMELY helpful and the weekly quizzes & review sessions he gave before exams were the only good part. Webassign was used for hw. Lab never took the full time and we even wrote up the report every week and turned it in before leaving. Beware of the final; no curve at the end
Put simply, some will like him and some wont
Very strict on grading. Barely any partial credit, practically 0. Attendance is mandatory and labs are annoying. Quizzes are an essential to study for because if you dont study you will get a 0. Exams are hard and many people will fail the class. Final exam was impossible. Although there is a slight change in the grading scale.
Lecture is completely useless, slides make no sense the first time you see them, and it doesn't help that he blazes through them. Labs are idiotic, and don't help you learn anything, and the text sucks. You'll fail a quiz or two but whatever, everyone does. Discussion was surprisingly helpful. Overall though the class was horrible, as was Xiao.
Dr. Xiao was a very good professor. It was not an extrememly easy course but it also wasn't particularlu time consuming. THe most time I put into the course was studying for exams. The exams are very close to the practice exams and often contain some of the same questions. All of his notes are online and he is very approachable. Take him!
This class will come sneak up on you and bite you. It's easy to blow it off but don't because you will be sorry. Many of my friends got D's and F's.
i loved his accent, especially when he said ""lotate countacrockwise.""  he's a fairly decent teacher and can be sort of confusing with his accent, but he's always willing to help out.  just don't slack off in that class and you'll get an A.
likes that he is very tall and chinese. interesting. tallest chinese man since yao ming. only posted one of my minute papers when every one was golden material. needs to work on that.
Does little examples in class.  Test are strait forward.  Is very funny
Great teacher. Makes physics doable. Slides and homework cover everything you could possibly need to know for the tests, plus a very very slight curve at the end of the semester makes this a good class to take.","Lecture is completely useless, slides make no sense the first time you see them, and it doesn't help that he blazes through them.

74,"Very soft, encouraging, and kind. Gives great feedback and really helps with writing. Does one on one meetings with students in order to make sure each one gets in depth feedback on all papers.
On new graduate student orientation, professor McCoy as our chair gave an inspirational speech to welcome everyone. She has the vision of a real scientist, and her speech connects to my heart. I feel that I could be someone that really use my research to change the world. I want to thank her for extending my funding, a great caring professor.
Very good prof. Took 3 classes with her. Tends to give good grades if you give a decent effort. Some classes are focused very much around discussion instead of technical learning ... for better or worse.
While she is a very kind person, who genuinely does want to help, half the the time she seems like she has no idea what she is doing or talking about. We spend a lot of class time watching her try to figure out how her computer works. She constantly second guesses herself which leaves everyone very confused.
The class is basically based on the lab. Unfortunately the lectures sometimes don't cover lab material in time so you find yourself stuck sometimes. Office hours are going to have to be part of your schedule to pass. Oh, and it's a problem when a computer science professor doesn't know how to hook a laptop up to a projector.
Just wants to help but was not very good at explaining herself. Her classes are behind the labs so you will show up to lab and just be sitting there clueless and the Lab TA's do not help at all. It's pretty bad because it could have been a great class if taught right.
Very good professor who really wants to help her students understand computer science. If you are having trouble understanding the material by all means, go to office hours. She is extremely helpful and will help teach you through the labs explaining the concepts necessary to complete them.
She is a very nice woman who definitely means well but most of the time she seems really confused. She spends too much class time going over old material and barely addresses new material that we need to know for labs. We didn't learn Java but were thrown into a java lab. i recommend taking another professor.
She means well, but fails at every other aspect. She assumes the class understands what's going on bc she really doesn't. She constantly is second guessing herself which doesn't help the class progress,& she rarely covers a topic before the required lab because she spends too much time taking attendance or doing something wrong. Take w another prof
Very kind and personable professor. She did go a bit slow at times, and I was often ahead of her myself. But it's an intro. class so you can't expect anything else. If anything she's a great professor for true beginners. Exams are easy if you do the practice exams she puts up beforehand. The class itself(labs)is challenging, but in a good way.
I think she is a good teacher. The course itself is very hard, and it's not teacher's fault. overall, her exam is not hard and the lab score is base on the TA you choose.
SHe was very nice and very funny.  Class was easy at first, but got really hard really fast.  She was not helpful, was very bad at explaining things and gave really bad examples.  She did not teach us how to do the assignments for the required lab.  Took way too many hours a week and I was barely able to pass the class.
My favorite teacher in all my years at the University of Delaware. She made learning computer science fun.
She is the best teacher I ever had! I wish I could take her for all my classes.
Dr. McCoy is freaking clown shoes. Like Eli, she is the best mayne, she deed it. That means she's completely awful. She once did check-expects for 40 minutes until she realized she was doing it wrong and then proceeded to correct herself for another 10-15 minutes, and then for the remaining 20 taught the material she intended, poorly at that.
She is crazy! She is not teaching at all. She is just wasting students time in class and try to arrange extra classes. If you really wanna learn AI avoid her. Try to take from others.Thus I have seen worst TA in my college life.
Extremely nice, caring, compassionate professor.  Tests are appropriately difficult.  Not the easiest class but easy to do well if you study and give it the attention it deserves.
With any other professor, this class is tough. With her it was a lot easier. I ended up getting an A without much trouble, an impossible feat with other profs. Lectures were from PowerPoint. Homeworks weren't too bad. Tests were hard but not impossible.
Good teacher for a hard class. :)","SHe was very nice and very funny.  Class was easy at first, but got really hard really fast.

90,"He is a terrible professor. His grading is very vague and does not give feedback when needed. His lectures are entirely discussion-based and he will take off points if you miss class or don't participate.  
Professor Fox is easily one of the best professors at UD. He is such an interesting and intelligent person which make his class easy to become engaged in. Your grade is based off of mostly participation but this includes simply just asking questions. I highly recommend doing the readings to be able to participate better during class discussions. 
Fox is the best professor I've ever had! Every low rating on this page is written by someone with no work ethic or interest in the subjects he teaches. Fox is knowledgable and passionate, changing your perspective with every class and encouraging you to think critically. If you take one class at UD, make sure it's with Fox. 
If I could minor in courses only taught by Fox I would, I want to take every possible class he teaches. He is that good. Probably one of the most knowledgeable and passionate professors I have ever had, never learned more about a subject in a single semester. HIGHLY recommend. If you are interested in religion its a must-take course
He's amazing and really fun. He gets personal and knows all of his students by name. His lectures are great and he gives anecdotes and examples to help you understand a complicated subject more easily. However, the reading amount in this class is really intense, so if you don't like reading (or tbh, don't have the time), steer clear of this course.
Alan Fox is what all teachers should strive to be. His presence invigorates me. He is a very kind and caring man, I always felt safe and secure in his sexy presence. I once saw him take down 10 ruffians in one move. Take this professor if you can! 
Avoid this class at all costs
Spends as much time talking about himself and his own ideas as he does the actual philosophers. Harsh grader, and somewhat condescending in person- definitely likes feeling like an authority. If you like Chinese philosophy you'll still get a lot out of the class (I did), but it's in spite of Fox, not because of it.
Absolutely loved this class. Not challenging at all if you actually put the work in. Class is all incredible and engaging lectures. There are short one page papers that you will receive an A for with basic effort. Two big take home essay exams that are graded fairly. Participation really matters, be prepared to contribute to class discussion. 
Great professor and would take again. Class consisted of about one reading and a short paper each week (not graded hard). Participation is part of your grade but you will do a lot better on exams asking questions and taking notes in class and the material is interesting. Midterm and final were the only exams and both take home. 
Avoid if you can
Dr. Fox's class was definitely challenging the whole semester and there was a lot of work that needed to be put in to do somewhat well. You actually have to do the readings he assigns otherwise you are not going to understand what he says. Very strict grader. Other than that he is a really nice professor and knows what he is talking about.
This professor is just difficult if you care about your grade avoid him. He barely gives feedback and when he does he just insults you.
Def not an easy A. I consider myself a pretty good student and I barely passed. All your grades are based on writing. You also need to be prepared to ready 100 pages of the bible or other religious books a night and then write about them. Tanked my gpa for no reason.
The class consists of 10 1-2 page essay assignments and two open-note exams. The exams have 3 short essays and one longer essay. The class is very interesting. A lot of reading and overeviewing material is needed for a good grade. The professor makes class fun to go to and makes the information intriguing.
8 1-2 page papers, 25% of grade: pass (95 A), pass minus (75 C) and not pass (50 F). 100% for doing all of them. 25% participation: go to class and speak up for a 95%. 50% take-home midterm/final. Challenging, but manageable if you keep up. Fantastic lecturer and educator. Witty, eloquent, energetic, compassionate, precise, responsive, engaging.
Professor Fox is a good professor, very enthused about his teachings. However, if you aren't prepared to argue your view 100%, you won't get credit if it goes against his. Must be paying attention at all times, little to no notes are written on the board. And you must read everything otherwise you'll be lost. Participation is a must, gets graded.
I took two of his classes so far and enjoyed myself during the lectures. He is passionate about in-class interaction and gives good feedback if you ask for it. Writing, reading, and participation matter in his class since homework is based on textbook understanding and exams are based on lectures comprehension. Great instructor of Asian PHIL study!
assigns readings on the material but wants you to basically repeat his own beliefs that he had during class discussion, which is just him talking at you and then asking if you have any problems with what he said. you can do alllllll the readings but if you dont ride on his beliefs, youll fail. weird for a philosophy class.
This class is awesome. As you put in effort and follow some of the easy recommendations in his syllabus. If you are taking this class for an easy A, that is a poor choice. This class is fun, if you put in the work.","I took two of his classes so far and enjoyed myself during the lectures.

92,"Mid teacher
He is very unorganized but he focuses on the grammar and making sure you understand how to use each word and conjugation properly. You do get graded on your attendance but if you still turn in your work and show an understanding of the material he will cut you some slack. He gives you until the end of the semester to make up any written or online.
Professor Bellamy is not a good professor at all. His grading system consists of a homework grade and a test grade, and whichever is lower is your average. 2 of the tests are kind of easy, but one is very hard and it will ruin your average. He is also not good at explaining anything.
Professor Bellamy is not as bad as he seems the first week of class. He doesn't have a Sakai or Canvas page so you must keep track of your grades yourself, but he is a great professor. Homework is hard, but you do not have to complete all of them to get an A. Exams are the easiest part of the class, which is a nice change of pace for a math class.
This class is really dumb and easy. The grading system seems hard but he is very generous with points. Half the class didn't take the final because he said it couldn't hurt your grade and we already had A's.
At first, Bellamy seems awful. Discrete is a pretty tough subject and he is unorganized as can be. He writes out long boring proofs that you can pretty much space out and ignore a lot of the time. However, even though his grading scales seem super weird, if you put in a decent amount of effort in it is actually fairly easy to get an A. 
His lectures are so frustrating: he just stands at the board and rambles on without actually checking if you understand it or not.  He gives a normal amount of homework which are pretty hard, but the test questions are always easier than the homework.  You have to put in a lot of individual effort in order to do well.
150 points is an A and you get points for asking questions, going to class, and doing proofs. If you put the work in you'll get an A.
He uses a point-based grading system for all of his classes, so if you put the work in early, you don't have to take the final or show up for the last few weeks of class. Get up to the board to do some proofs as soon as possible.
The class is not tough like people talked about, but this professor is not good one to take. In the class, he just follow his thoughts to talk in spite of whether students can follow or not. handwriting is confusing.
I took him when i had no other options. He's the easiest of the professors, just the class material is somewhat confusing. His grading system is weird but makes it easy. His Exams are easier than homeworks by far, and you can study with friends for the homework. Would recommend him.
I think Bellamy is great. You don't have a textbook in this class. I love the way he grades his students. Basically if you work hard enough you will get an A in the class, and it doesn't matter how you do on exams. He's a nice guy, terrible with names. Still doesn't know mine. Taking him again next semester.
I'm taking this class now, and it's most likely the most difficult class I have ever taken. Don't expect to learn too much from the lectures as the notation can be quite confusing. If you don't understand one little detail, it's unlikely you'll be able to fully comprehend the proof or theorem he's writing on the board. READ the text and do the HW.
Bellamy is one of the worst professors I've ever had.  He really doesnt care if you understand the material or if you pass the class.  He tells you to ask questions but then makes you feel stupid for asking that question.  Seriously, dont take him unless you want to fail
He isn't always the most clear and doesn't necessarily get up to teach this course. He makes you learn proofs by presenting them. Its pretty easy to rack up points and he has a unique grading scale that pretty much gaurentees you to pass if you come to class
You should avoid Bellamy..Not a good professor at all. Tests are very hard, and he doesn't care about his students' grades at all. AVOID
he's not exactly a good professor. If you have to take him, don't sweat it but I wouldn't choose to have him. Nobody really knows what he's talking about, but he usually gives an overall feeling of what the exams look like. Grade is based on the lower of your test grade and hw grade, so it's important that you do your hw. Not impossible to get A/B
Easy class if you've already taken calculus. If you haven't, you're going to have to study a lot. He teaches through sample problems, then assigns very similar ones for homework. Tests are pretty easy, he gives 5 questions on each test where each problem is worth 25 points but the test is graded out of 100 points. Overall, easy class.
The teacher is nice. Grading system is great. It is easy to get a good grade if you work hard. Calculus teacher can not teach you every single algebra. This teacher can give students a good start. You need to work on them after class. He does not care about the antecedence and texting during class. Just a little homework will be provided.
A great professor.  A litter home+not required participation. It's easy to gain A. I got 100+ in all three exams.","His lectures are so frustrating: he just stands at the board and rambles on without actually checking if you understand it or not.  He gives a normal amount of homework which are pretty hard, but the test questions are always easier than the homework.  You have to put in a lot of individual effort in order to do well."
94,"Love this class!! 10/10
Lectures go in circles and powerpoints are just pictures from the textbook. You dont have to go to class unless its a PBL day (which she says in advance). If your PBLs are extremely detailed, you will do well. Tests are MC& very hard. I didnt go to class,but studied for hours&read the book and got an A. She has a hugeee curve at the end (84 & upA)
This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken.  The powerpoints were unclear, and she talked in circles the whole time.  She gave maybe 30 seconds to write down all of the information on a slide, which never made sense anyway.  It's better to just skip class and watch Khan Academy videos and then rely on the curve for your final grade.
She was not a great professor. She was very hard to understand and her tests are nearly impossible. Most of us got Ds and Fs on the tests, but she adds a huge curve at the end of the semester.. Group projects and lab will bring your grade up. Don't buy the textbook. Good luck!!
Lectures are scattered and very confusing- sometimes she throws in unnecessary details. Use the textbook and her PPTs on sakai for clarity. Despite her confusing lectures she is such a nice lady and is willing to help her students as long as they ask. Go to her office hours if you're confused about a topic and she will likely help you!
I really liked Dr. Schmieg as a person, she was really nice but a confusing professor. Although her tests are hard everything is curved and the labs really helped with grades so don't worry! Taking ap bio in high school was a big help.  The textbook helped me a lot. 
You could study for 30 hours for Florence's exams and still only get a 44. But don't worry, group PBL's and Bio Lab and her curve will boost your grade to at least a C! Don't bother showing up, getting the textbook, or even studying for that matter.
The class is all memorization, and not nearly as difficult as everyone makes it seem. If you have background in bio already, then it will be a piece of cake. Otherwise, if you just skim the chapters the night before the exams, then you can get an A pretty easily with minimal effort. 84 and up was an A. Not the best prof, but it's an intro course
Hard class but if you took AP Bio you are set. Be prepared to teach yourself after each lecture. You  have to knit together bits and pieces of her lecture and make connections she doesn't point out in class.  Tests were easy for me but very hard for others. She gives practice tests but you really need to understand the material thoroughly. 
Her lectures are incredibly confusing. It is sometimes more beneficial to read the book alongside the powerpoint than to try to understand her confusing lectures. If you try to follow along to her lectures, be sure to bring your laptop, or you'll oftentimes be scrambling to write a full slide of notes in 20 seconds.
Worst class I ever took. Tests are impossible, lectures are confusing and put you to sleep. She is extremely unclear on her PBL assignments and just excepts the students to read her mind. Never done as bad in a course in my life as I did in her bio 205, and I am a health science major.
Lectures basically consist of going through the figures from the book and having her explain it to the best of her ability.  To prepare for tests you have to read through the book and memorize every part of every slide.  If you can do that you will do well... its not easy. Final Group project helps bring grade up by a bit since she grades it easily
Doesn't know what she's talking about, doesn't help students at all in class. When questions are asked, she rarely responds without a question as an answer. She steals her powerpoints from the book and claims that her slides are better than the book. 
Dr. Schmieg is a nice lady, but she is really boring. She sounds very monotone and everything she teaches is directly from the textbook. She also has a really good curve which helped boost my grade. If you want to do well, read the textbook and try your best in lab (there's a lab final at the end of the semester).
She is terrible. her teaching style is very monotone, she's probably the most boring person I've ever had to talk to. She's no where near helpful and has a really bad attitude. Her tests are impossible to pass with higher than a 69.
Absolutely terrible. I could've (and have) learned more from prudent use of wikipedia than from enduring this class. Obviously taught for pre-meds who live by rote memorization. She is not at all gracious when answering questions, which really makes me question how competent she is to be teaching this material in the first place.
She is absolutely terrible. she talks in circles the entire class and her exams are impossible. the class average is usually a 58 and I would rather stay home and read through the book than go sit through class.
terrible teacher, reads straight off of power points and isn't clear with information
Very bad professor. if you took AP Biology in high school you should be fine but if you didn't youre out of luck. She goes so fast and just reads off her power points. Tests very hard, 3 and a final(not cumulative). Relied on labs, group projects and the curve.
She really knows her stuff but she is not clear at all. If you do attend class, bring your computer to take notes and just listen to what she says. She bounces around slides a lot but atleast she uses pictures. She has a huge curve cause she doesn't want us to fail. Make sure you get all the easy points you can! She's nice but unorganized.","Very bad professor. if you took AP Biology in high school you should be fine but if you didn't youre out of luck. She goes so fast and just reads off her power points.

98,"Great teacher, makes things easy to understand. Really important to go to his exam reviews, they help so much if you have missed a class or two.
Four 4-5 page reflection papers, two all written exams, one group speech project and one final take home 10-12 page essay. There's a fair amount of writing in the class, but it isn't terrible because he's not a super tough grader. You have to put in work in the class, but show an interest, work hard and you can get an A.
The whole class is Dr. Carrion reading off of slides that are word for word from the textbook. The TA was super unhelpful and could not correctly answer questions with problems in lab. The lab portion was a waste of time, only one or two concepts from lab was applicable for the final paper.
Dr. Carrion is amazing. He is so funny, passionate and knowledgeable about everything. It's really important to do the readings in order to do well on the exams, but I sort of did them and pulled off a B+. His class wasn't a joke but it was really interesting and enjoyable. I highly recommend him and this class!
Only took this class since it was required for all Political Science majors, but it has no actual politics discussed. He gives weekly hw assignments and three or four tests, all written no multiple choice. Plus you have to learn to program SPSS and write a 14 page on it. Did not enjoy but got through it. Said he'd curve the class but never did...
Mi estimado CarriÃ³n, always be looking out for you. I love his class. I would definitely take his class if I could. Very clear: 4  short essays, 2 exams and 1 take home (12-15 page paper).
Highly recommended. Great professor who cares about his students. 2 exams, take home final, and 4 easy short response essays. There is a fair amount of reading and material, but it's straightforward.
Two exams and one final paper are all that is needed for this class. You can show up to class, but as long as you read the assigned papers a week before the exam, you should be fine in this class.
If he's as good at barbecue as his son is then this guy is legit!!!!!!! Also adorable!!!!
Excellent professor. Highly recommend his course. Very knowledgeable and friendly.
Two tests and a final paper. He gives out study guides for the tests, but not only a few days ahead of time, so there isn't much time to do them. He uses the same questions from the study guides on the tests. He seems to know everything about Latin America.  Would definitely recommend a class with him.
I love love love this class! Very interesting and engaging. Professor Carrion is challenging but casual and friendly. He is a very smart man and does an incredible job of explaining different topics. I do not have a single complaint about him or the class and I definitely would recommend him to other students.
How does he not have a chili pepper yet? He's so cute!
Great teacher.  Helpful
Great professor, very smart and incredibly helpful.  Fair grader, you will learn so much.
Write your opinion and views on the test.. understanding over memorizatiion
nicest guy ever. very funny/nerdy. go to class, he's helpful and really sweet!
great teacher, always willing to help, funny and smart
Nice guy..funny..he goes over tests after TA grades and makes them better
Julio is THE MAN-study guides are right on target. hes so cute too!",Excellent professor. Highly recommend his course. Very knowledgeable and friendly.
100,"One of the worst classes I have ever taken. The lectures were boring, he solely read off the slides. The exams were fairly difficult and stressful because they were the only thing that counted for a grade. You never actually know you grade either because he goes off of the class average for grading, so we never really knew.
Our entire grade is comprised of 3 multiple choice exams. They weren't too difficult it made them far more nerve wracking as there was no breathing room to mess up on even 1. Plus his lectures are incredibly boring, al he does is read off a powerpoint, I think I fell asleep the entire first month. He was a alright guy but the course was just lazy.
Very easy course & informative. Attendance is not mandatory but watch the lectures before the exams. No assignments others than the exams so watch the lectures and do the 10 practice problems for each test. EXAMS ARE MULTIPLE CHOICE. I retyped all the notes along with the recordings at 1.5x speed and it's an easy A. Little dry but easy to follow!!
Absolutely awful professor. Lectures are so boring and have so much information in them. Exams are so much more confusing than the practice questions. The only grades for this class are 2 midterms and a final. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. trust me. avoid.
This guy sits in front of the class and lectures for an hour and 15 straight with no interaction with students, expects you to know an insane amount of material that culminates to a midterm worth 33% and a final worth 67%. Had a B+ at the midterm and finished almost failing the class. What the hell
The book is useless, participation isn't mandatory, and he puts his slides online. The final is cumulative, and it absolutely sucks studying for. He's very knowledgeable but his lectures are boring, especially when nobody comes to class. Only 3 exams.. straight forward class, but very hard to get an A in. Take class if necessary, avoid if possible.
Nice guy who has straightforward expectations. Above all else, study the outlines!
Class is a bit boring, which is ok with me. Don't let other comments saying that it's an extremely easy class fool you. You'll have to know your stuff pretty well. It's not just what I personally think, it's agreed among all of the classmates I know. Hard work won't be equal to A, but a HARD HARD WORK. I got an A by the way. And I learnt a lot.
The topics and information taught are interesting.  Tends to jump around a lot when he lectures.  Not very clear on what you need to know for the exams.  Exams do not assess what you learn in class and how much you study.  I would not recommend him.
Not a tremendously difficult class, but not an easy A. Entire grade based on 2 exams and a cumulative final. Exams are multiple choice with a few short answer questions. Exams are somewhat difficult to study for because they cover a lot of material and it's not exactly clear what you will be tested on. Overall an OK class.
Three exams during the semester. Attendance isn't mandatory. Not a hard class but extremely boring. Doesn't do anything but lecture for 50 minutes, absolutely no interaction with students.
Attendance not mandatory. Class boring. Textbook worthless.  Everything on tests from outlines. Its 25% for each test and 50% for the final. You can drop a test to shift the weights to 33% and 66%.  Tests were easy (almost identical to old tests) but final was difficult. Had A going into final, finished w B. Didnt really study though
Not a hard class but it is extremely boring. All you need to know for the tests is the outlines he hands out and you will do fine.  Two tests and a final and if you need one of the exams will be dropped...VERY BORING THOUGH
WORST CLASS!!!! avoid teacher at all costs.......... u walk in class and he just starts talking for 50 min straight.  so boring and not one student spoke the entire semester.  2 midterms that are pointless bc the final is 66% of your grade which is a 20 chp cumulative final.  BULL!!!!
Boring class, in a nutshell there is a lot of bureaucracy and rent-seeking behavior in developing countries. Also, trade is good. You will be bombarded w/ articles and random clusters of information centered around these basic themes. Has very little to do w/ economics. Prof will send you into a comatose-like state w/ his rambling, avoid.
Easy. Great Professor. Extremely intelligent. Learned so much! one of the best classes at UD. go to class--the tests are all from lectures and almost nothing from the textbook and papers. if you take notes in class--its an easy A+. Wonderful class.
Ridiculous grading system, All around Awful class.  More notes and handouts than an entire volume of Encyclopedia Brittanica, which you will need to know for the final exam which is worth more than two thirds of your final grade (67%).
Just avoid him! He will burn you out. He is Jekyll and Hyde.  In class is he Mr. Happy go lucky.  After class it is a whole another story.  IS helpful as long as it is something small. You heard it here. Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid!!! Terrible!
He talks way to fast.  He tries to fit like 2 lectures into one.  We do take other classes you know!. He is clueless and a must avoid!
I had lots of interest coming to this class, but this guy puts you to sleep really quickly (I mean the entire class).  His grading scale is ludacrious.   HE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE, but I would not take another class with him, EVER HOPEFULLY!","One of the worst classes I have ever taken. The lectures were boring, he solely read off the slides. The exams were fairly difficult and stressful because they were the only thing that counted for a grade. You never actually know you grade either because he goes off of the class average for grading, so we never really knew."
102,"Dr. Link knows A LOT about economics! Sometimes lectures get boring, you have to learn on your own, he uses old style lectures, and he does not tell you your grade on Canvas which sucksss. Don't procrastinate, study before exams and you should be fine. 3 main course components: exams, modules, and problem sets. 

Dr. Link is very smart and very passionate about economics. You won't meet anyone more experienced than him. As a teacher, he isn't bad per se, but explains things in an overly complicated way. I found that the Asarta videos and other online resources were more helpful than class oftentimes. The tests are very fair, though.
Link is the best, go to class, do your homework, and do the practice exams and you will be fine.
A great choice and should be an easy A. He gives practice exams for all of the tests which are really helpful. In addition, he makes the average a B-. For example, if the average on a test in a 68, that is a B- so a 84 or 85 would be an A. His lectures are outdated but they get the job done and clearly teach you the concepts. Would recommend!
Love Link, think he's a great guy, but he is not the best teacher. His lectures are very confusing to the point that I stopped paying attention. He tries to be helpful, but ends up confusing you more. This class was very hard for me, but he did give a good curve at the end.
Dr. Link made economics interesting and easy. You don't need the textbook because he gives you most of the notes, and it's easiest to just show up for lectures. He makes class engaging with dance and joke breaks, and gives some of the test questions and answers on the sample exams, especially for the final. Some grades are completion-based.
He's a very nice guy so long as you're respectful. His main problem is that he can over-explain things, by that I mean he can clump so many concepts into one explanation that they become so complicated in your head. My advice: watch the optional Asarta videos, they explain things so simply and each are about 3-5 minutes.
Everything is all set up for you at the beginning of the semester. Homework due dates, exam dates. Lectures are super boring, but that's microeconomics to me in general. Link is a good Professor, he even has practice exams for each exam we take. I would recommend to take him.
If you don't understand econ, you won't understand the class. He locks your grade so you have no idea how you are doing all semester, and he doesn't make it easy to calculate your grade. He gets annoyed when people email him, and his responses to emails are usually short and unhelpful. He doesn't explain content very well, so you have to study hard
Although he isn't the best with technology, he still can properly teach microeconomics. Professor Link is extremely passionate and knowledgeable when it comes to economics. He's a little quirky, but that's what makes his lectures interesting. I would definitely take another class with him again.
Dr. Link gets basic economic concepts across clearly and often times entertainingly. He gives practice exams, and many of the questions on the tests come directly from the homework, and he tells you this specifically. Yes, the slides are a little dated-looking, but otherwise he is a very good professor.
He is a great ECON professor and would definitely take him again if I wasn't switching colleges. I appreciated how passionate and experienced he. Some topics are heavy, but just study. He makes sure he talks about every concept and small thing you need to know. HW is easy and helpful. He gives practice exams. Pay attention to lectures and study.
Dr. Link is a good Econ teacher. He is experienced, articulate of his ideas and quirky (which makes his lectures interesting). He wants to you to be engaged in his class. The only drawback is that sometimes his lectures feel like they get dragged out a bit. Otherwise, solid professor!
Professor Link is just okay. His lectures are very boring, but eventually his message gets across. He is absolutely terrible with technology, and his grading system sucks because you pick the grade you want to get but could still do terribly. Feedback he gives is limited and not helpful. Not a bad guy, but a little old in terms of teaching style.
Same lectures from 15 years ago. Very rude responses when students ask him questions. Doesn't know how to work a computer (given his age).
Subject matter and lectures are dry, and there are a lot of them. Overall, Dr. Link explains things pretty clearly and I never had to ask him any questions. He's kind of crotchety when it comes to technology, so be warned about him responding to your emails. Homework is really easy and is actually helpful for tests. Study and you'll do fine
I took Link's class as an asynchronous class, which turned out to be fantastic. His lectures were easy to follow and the additional videos and modules he provides give all the extra information that might be necessary on the exams. He is very easy to reach and is very understanding. I would not have gotten good grades first semester without him.
in 2020 a time where many good professors struggled to successfully get their material across, Prof. Link had no problem. I found that his lectures were fun and enjoyable to listen to. He explained the material in a way that made it easy to understand and easy to take notes on. The homework was helpful and was not just busywork
I took Charles Link for the Winter Session (5 weeks) as a breadth and he was great. His class was asynchronous so you should watch his lectures and he has a good organization for his exams. There are 4 exams the last one being cumulative. He offers a chance to bring your grade up through his system that can count your final heavier than usual.
Do not take this class online. Extremely lecture heavy and the way he lays out his modules is confusing. Videos are also reused from like 2015. You have no contact with him at all during the semester, his TA is the one who hosts review sessions. Review sessions are also not helpful. May be better in person but online its very hard for a 101.","Subject matter and lectures are dry, and there are a lot of them.

104,"Professor Brophy has easily become one of my new favorite professor's at UD. The class is definitely very stimulating in terms of the conversations that go on because he is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the topics at hand. He definitely is a tough grader but gives great feedback that you can use to improve upon your writing with.
Dr. Brophy is amazing but challenging in good ways! I enjoyed having him as a professor although I specialize in American history. Very understanding and is flexible with extensions if you show up and participate. Lots of reading, writing, and book reviews but it definitely prepares for your future in history. 
Professor Brophy is an excellent professor who really cares about his students. There are a lot of writing and reading assignments, but he is clear with what he expects and he makes discussions interesting. You have to read everything he assigns because the class is a seminar.
He assigned a lot of papers, most of which based on books we read and a research paper, but I had no problem with this. My major is to write about history, so I can't complain about that. He was insanely flexible with due dates and pushed back tests and papers a couple times. I accidentally submitted my final late, but he was very understanding.
Professor Brophy is by far the best teacher I've ever had in my life. He is the stereotypical college history professor in all the best ways. I have taken multiple classes with him and have enjoyed every second. He definitely is a hard grader, but it will only make you even better. Highly recommend taking his courses!
Took him for Europe in Crisis. Cool course that stimulated my interest in the subject and made me want to read more books about it in my free time. The term paper is tough while you're doing it so pick your topic early. He really appreciates when students participate in discussions and ask questions so it likely helps when he's grading your stuff.
Professor Brophy really cares about his students. If you ever email him, he will answer you right away and is very kind. Just be ready to read a lot and he is a tough grader. but if you meet beforehand, he takes that into consideration.
Brophy is a kind professor who clearly knows his subject. He did a good job with the online format even though it was clearly new to him. Very few assignments, mostly just lectures. The only issue with him is that he is a BRUTAL grader for his paper, however he is very willing to give extra time to help students improve, he wants you to succeed.
Amazing professor and amazing person. Would take a class again with him in a heartbeat. The kind of professor you wouldn't want to skip their class just because you wouldn't want to make them sad and you would want them to like you.
Dr. Brophy lecture's show how much he cares about the topic, but they can be long. he does expect his students to read a lot and reflect on what they read in Friday discussions. there are 3-4 write requirements.
Amazing professor, really cares about the subject and the students. Knows a lot about what he's teaching. Don't text or use your phone in class, he will call you out on it.
I LOVE Dr. Brophy. He is by far one of the best professors in the history department. I have taken three classes with him and have loved every single one. He truly cares for his students and if you go to office hours he answers all your questions, and then will talk about his time in Europe for the remaining time you are there.! Truly inspirational
I had him for History 102, when I used to be an IR major. Amazing teacher. He was so knowledgable, and made the content incredibly interesting. Definitely not an easy class, but your work will pay off. I wish their were more professors here at UD that were like him.
You better agree with him, if not prepare to be eaten alive. Defiantly would have been better in  more formal classroom not a Seminar on European nationalism, a truly ridiculous subject.  -Weekly Papers -Intensive examination of writing proses, grammar, and your inter being. -Not recommended Content is disgustingly boring
Brophy is a crack up and absolute history nerd. The guy is passionate and demands an incredible amount from his students. Do your readings, and do them religiously. He loves assigning reviews and demands clarity, so be ready for lots of underlining on your first papers. 
I loved this class, Professor Brophy was amazing and so passionate. The readings aren't mandatory to pass but they are interesting. 3 exams and 1 paper. He gave us a list of terms to study for the exam but DON'T use wikipideia and you'll do fine. Take the class even if the topic doesn't interest you.
This guy is adorable. Class is organized and interesting, tests are easy enough, and the reading isn't too bad. If you're interested in the Holocaust, don't miss this class--but seriously, don't text in this class. It's disrespectful and he will call you out for it.
Best Professor I've ever had. Lectures are clear, concise, and fascinating. Brophy demonstrations lots of knowledge and passion in his field. He covers a lot of detail, but hey, that's how you learn! There are a lot of required readings, but most are interesting. He's not a hard grader to boot. Cannot recommend highly enough.
Brophy is so nice and helpful. He gives you a lot of information and is very knowledgable about the subject. Two papers and two exams that cover a lot of information.
Really nice guy. Super into what he's teaching and really knows a lot about it. Gives students the benefit of the doubt. Rarely came to class but still got an A- in the class. One midterm, group project, final paper, and a final. Lenient grader. Show up like once a week and you'll be fine.","Best Professor I've ever had. Lectures are clear, concise, and fascinating.

107,"Awful at teaching, doesn't explain anything. Starts every answer off with ""obviously..."" and doesn't explain why it's so obvious. Thinks way too much of himself. If you can teach yourself from a textbook take it, otherwise don't. Don't expect a change in grades either.
Brilliant professor who's occasionally pretty funny. HW is not graded but it is helpful  and going to class all the time isn't entirely necessary as long as you review the course notes and study the text. Let's you retake one of your exams but the class is not too difficult if you put the time into it and practice. Take logic with Boorse!
Terrible professor. He moves very quickly in class, just write stuff down and try to understand it later. The material itself is not too difficult, there's just a learning curve. Takes a while and some work to click, but once it does, you're golden. TA is very helpful. DO HOMEWORK! Not graded, but it helps you. Other than that, textbook is useless.
Boorse is pretty awesome. I'm taking his class now and loving it. He likes what he does and he's pretty funny (he cracks himself up). If you go at least to the last few classes before an exam you should be fine. He goes over everything and gives practice tests. 3 tests and homework.
Dr. Boorse's advanced logic seminars are excellent. They're small classes designed to teach about a specific part of mathematical or philosophical logic. Boorse knows his subject well, he is flexible in what he teaches, and he develops a good rapport with the students. I hear he might be teaching a seminar on deviant logic in spring 2011. Take it.
Do NOT listen to anything anyone else is saying, the class is useless, its hard, you can't pay attention and learn much because its not structured at all, take something else if at all possible
Amazing professor. Keeps me interested and laughing all whilst learning :) You MUST take this hottie's class!!
Greatest professor that has ever walked the earth. You'll learn tons about Basic Decision Theory and lots about other things too. And he has a pepper now.
Was very interesting and informative... clearly had a good grasp on the subject matter.  Was very funny and kept the mood of the class light.  Take the class for an interesting Group A.
Between an extremely well written text book and a professor who knows logic like the back of his hand you will be well off. Do the homework, yes it takes a long time, but compared to the homework the tests are a relief. You don't have to even like math to get into the puzzle solving of Logic. Just flow with it. Tutoring is available for free.
Boorse is one of the funniest professors I've had at UD. Great sense of humor and extremely intelligent. If you practice problems, logic quickly becomes very interesting and doable. Make a good effort and you'll get a B. 3 tests, first 2 are easy, final is difficult. Class not mandatory but don't skip or you'll be lost. I recommend him.
This class is pretty interesting, and good for people who like to do puzzles.  Boorse has the strangest sense of humor - like when he used logic to suggest that Jennifer Aniston left Brad Pitt for him...  Wait until office hours to ask questions, or else he'll make you look like a fool in front of the whole class.
one of the best professors here. good sense of humor.
Boorse rocks my world!  He's probably one of the best (and most intelligent) professors I've had at UD.
I thought this course was good when I first took it and my appreciation has only grown with time  It was not easy but provided a good foundation for later technical work and a great sharpening of one's thought processes
Logic? I mean hell....very difficult, study every nite or you will forget.
make nice, he hooks it up
Tries to make interesting & very fair grader, but the course material is HARD.
Extremely smart professor, one of Delaware's best. You will learn from him.
Great proffessor easy class makes a horribly boring subject fairly interesting","Boorse is one of the funniest professors I've had at UD. Great sense of humor and extremely intelligent.

110,"The man came off very distant, cranky, and rude. Can recall when he actually kicked me out of his office for asking too many question.  Regardless, the guy is still the best BISC403 prof in UD. His lectures are typically clear, and his exams are hard but doable if you put in time with notes, the book, and the practice exams. Scored a B. So can you.
TAKE SMITH!!! This class is a difficult class, but an A is possible. Dr. Smith is extremely helpful and for an 8 AM keeps everyone wide awake. One of the best biology teachers I've ever had I recommend him!! Take Notes on everything, study practice exams, read book and you will get a A or B
Dr. Smith is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about genetics. However, is exams are very tough. Be sure to thoroughly understand his notes and previous exams.
Dr. Smith is very passionate about what he teaches and usually willing to help. Make sure you go to class and take good notes because tests come straight form the notes. You won't even need to read the book. He is very good at explaining things so that they make sense too. If you have to take this class, definitely take it with Smith!
Take really good notes in this class, the exams come right out of lectures. Also, study the old test really well (understand all the questions). Overall, he explains things well and is willing to help you. Not too hard of a class, but make sure you study and UNDERSTAND concepts. Read over the assigned readings, it may help clear up some concepts.
I had heard that this class was hard, but it is very easy. If you know how to read, you will do well. If you do not know how to read, you will do well.
Dr. Smith is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his area of study and it clearly shows in his teaching. The material is challenging, but you should do okay if you pay attention and take good notes. The lab section of this class is horrendous, but you just have to grit your teeth and do it. Smith makes 8am class not entirely terrible.
Liked him so much for 300 I took him again! Wants his students to do well, holds study sessions @library the night before exams. Gets along with students and is very helpful to them. Enthusiastic about what he teaches, tests are very fair, easy to do well if you study. Will clarify anything you ask. Good teacher, smart prof, great guy.
Dr. Smith is somehow able to take an 8am class about bacteria and make it interesting enough to stay awake for! His lectures are very interesting, and he is very easy to find outside of class if you have questions. Exams are tough, but he gives you old exams to practice off of.
I was excited for this class, but the first few months were dedicated to punnett squares and simple mathematical calculation. Then suddenly everything became route memorization. Tough. Note: Do not do the difficult book problems he assigns for the first exam. There will generally only be easy ones on it. -READ THE BOOK-STUDY OLD EXAMS LIKE WOAH-
The best professor by far! He knows his stuff & is very passionate about Genetics. He really wants you to learn. Exams are tough!! Not an easy class but he makes an 8am class very exciting every time. He does NOT curve!! I learned a lot in this class. Make sure you do the assigned homework questions. Do practice exam. He is always ready to help!
Great professor, he's been teaching for over 30 years. He really knows the subject material, but carefully emphasizes the important information. He makes sure his instruction is very clear, because the subject can get pretty murky. He's great to talk to and he makes himself very available for help, especially right before exams.
tough class, no curve. i feel that he is prob good to have for multiple classes, but i just took him for micro and found him difficult and uncomfortably approachable. def study old tests and know concepts. lectures are good...if you can stay awake
Very interesting lectures, I didn't fall asleep once and I had him for an 8am. Knows what he teaches and makes it interesting by default somehow. Very easy to want to learn in his class, highly recommended.
Great class, except the middle third on taxonomy which is very tedious. Not as hard as in micro and genetics. 3 tests, all essays, based on lectures and assigned articles. Most of the class got A's and B's. Take it if you wanna learn something different and interesting and not the usual classical stuff
Amazing professor. Never fell asleep for a lecture - presents material very well. Difficult class (all BISC classes 400+ are) unless you keep up with the readings and go to his office hours. Beware the 1st Exam in Genetics - use the practice exams he gives you. You WILL learn Genetics in this class.
i had him for genetics, micro, and bacterial evolution and he is by far my favorite prof here. very personable and knowledgeable. excellent at teaching the material. must study, go to class, and read tho to get a good grade
BEST professor in the Bio department, Its a challenging class, but all 400 level bio classes are, if you do the work, he's more than happy to help you. GO TO STUDY SESSIONS, make sure you study the old exams he gives you a week before the test, they help A LOT. Overall, a hard class but worth it and there is no better professor to take it with.
Had him for genetics/micro. BEST professor, absolutely love him! Very helpful, go to him for help during office hours. Any bio class is challenging, but put in the work and you can do well. Make sure you look at old tests. For micro, outline why wrong answers are wrong (test qs are usually re-worded, be careful tho!). Genetics-go to study sessions!
best prof at delaware. hes tough but all 400 bio classes are. study old tests. go to him for help. attend review sessions. study the book. hardest bio class ive taken but id take this prof again any day. ive taken 3 classes with him cuz hes the best.","Dr. Smith is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his area of study and it clearly shows in his teaching.

111,"Arguably... One of the most intelligent men I know, he'd be set with these upset students that don't want to pay attention and dick around all day long... imagine paying to take a philosophy course only to either not do the work because your unsatisfied. I'd pay Douglas stalker to teach my kid about philosophy personally.
Gives an old time lecture; uses overhead projector; helps to go to class because each lecture assumes familiarity with previous; average grade just over a C; only one text; many handouts online explaining text and lecture topics; tests multiple choice; results curved; covers main problems of philosophy from analytic view.
badness all around
This class is painfully boring. He seems like a very nice guy, he isn't afraid to use his own odd form of wit, although some people find his wit awkward, I respect his comfort level up there when he is teaching. The class sucks though, it is difficult kind of, and his teaching style/voice/material is obscenely boring.
He seems like a nice guy, but his lectures are pretty ridiculously boring.  His tests are really hard, but he curves them.  On the first exam (out of two), I got the second highest grade in the class with an 82.  He's knowlegable and friendly.
after the 3rd class I went to Dr. Stalker's office hours with a good question, which he answered and we discussed. I totally understand everything that he says in class and am not suprised when he is mean to stupid people. If you ask a stupid question what do you expect, especially from a guy with severe chronic back pain. Quit whining!!!
The reason no one likes this man is because the majority of his students are idiots. If you ask a worthwile question he will answer, and will be very willing to help. However, if all you want is a better grade than you deserve than of course he will be mean to you, and should be mean to you because you are stupid and dont deserve to be at a college
I found the discussion of the lottery paradox especially interesting.  I'm now a determinist!
Multiple-guess exam format--just 2 a semester (easy in that respect if you can manage to avoid drifting as much as Stalker). He is the worse teacher I have had at UD, although he has written on many interesting and related topics and knows a lot of the people we studied.
terrible
This man hurts the soul. He is so boring, and doesn't even make sense half of the time. MY class was dead silent. by the end there were only 9 people out of 46! Just find another professor if you want this class. He was terrible.
Worst teacher I have ever had.  Total jerk when you try to get help from him.  Discourages class discussion in a PHILOSOPHY class!!!
I come to each class with an open mind and don't have favorites when it comes to Profesors, but, this might be the worst teacher I have ever encountered. He makes no sense at all, its almost as if he is talking to himself and not a large class. He is so vague<avoid the class at all costs!
he is the worst professor EVER. Do yourself a favor and drop his class NOW.
Class is pretty damn boring. I never went to class BUT i READ the entire book (it sucked the life outta me) and made my own notes. If you think your an above average or an excellent student take this course because its based on two exams which are graded on a z-score curve.
Hands down the worst prof I've had at UD. He yelled at a girl for putting her test in the wrong pile! A real jerk. Made fun of people who asked questions, IF he even called on people who HAD questions. Extremely vague, boring, and not a nice person at all. Seems to hate his job. UD should fire him!!
THIS CLASS SUCKED! DO NOT TAKE IT
Snooze alert!  I stopped going to class after the first exam bc a) it was 8AM 2) it was BORING and 3)I realized I could learn it from his handouts and the book.  Mult choice exams are challenging, but doable if you do work. If I had to hear him say ""whoops"" one more time I was going to strangle him.
Terrible, terrible class, get out while you still can, and I mean RUN!!! I had this 8am and it was impossible to stay awake. Attendance is imperative, and there are only 2 exams to decide your entire semester. I really didn't learn a thing
One of the easist classes i have had at UD. Its just 2 multiple choice exams, no work, no papers.  Kinda boring tho but you can pretty much skip every class if you read.",Worst teacher I have ever had.  Total jerk when you try to get help from him.  Discourages class discussion in a PHILOSOPHY class!!!
114,"I did well in Dr. Peeler's Molecular Biology class, I just found it very boring and such basic biological information that I found it hard to concentrate in class. He also just lectures the entire class and his voice is quite boring. If you want an easy A though, take his Molecular class.
Peeler was a very nice professor. Sometimes his grading was really harsh and other times you got an easy A. I would recommend him!
I loved Dr. Peelers class! He even brought in his dog on the last day. Lays out everything you need to do to succeed and if you put in the effort, he notices. Gives great advice too! Cant wait to have him again for cell bio next semester!
Clearly explained assignments, structured well, approachable, great professor
He is a really nice professor who is clearly highly intelligent.
Great professor! Dr. Peeler is extremely friendly and a fair grader.  He also makes the class not as difficult as it could be by allowing students to create PowerPoint projects as a grade booster. Many science classes are solely based on exams, but he purposely creates opportunities to raise your grade if you're not the best test taker.
I've heard he's awesome at teaching other bio courses, but genetics just isn't one of them. He rarely every lectured, so you were stuck depending on your group to help you understand the material. He always assigned readings from the textbook and we would almost always had a quiz. His exams are hard. Labs & essays barely saved my grade.
Took genetics with him and it was horrible. He rarely teaches or ever lectures. you must do the readings and during most classes there is a quiz. exams are hard as well. he's very laidback and willing to help if you have questions. got out of class early 99% of the time. lab reports and essays are what saved my grade.
Core Perspectives is interesting. Very laid back and not a hard grader. Pretty good teacher though.
Nice guy, but class is sleep-inducing
very nice guy and classes are extremely laid back.  He's pretty fair with grading.  However, class might benefit from a little more actual instruction time
Class is a little boring, but he's an awesome professor!
He should be cloned
Very clear, concise and makes difficult topics easy to understand.
Awesome teacher.  Laid back, and explains material very thoroughly. More than willing to answer questions and will often find a way to help you answer your own questions. Will give help if you ask for it.
very helpful, classes are interesting
very nice, laid back, very helpful, tests are not too bad","Awesome teacher.  Laid back, and explains material very thoroughly. More than willing to answer questions and will often find a way to help you answer your own questions. Will give help if you ask for it."
127,"Riley was awesome.  Told you exactly what to expect like no other undergrad teacher I have ever had.
Best teacher ever! He really tells it like it is! He may seem stern or mean, but he really prepares you for the industry. Have to take at least one class with him!
Avoid. Feels compelled to constantly insult every student in class for their work, even though he never actually shows how to properly do the assignments. Operates under the guise of ""preparing students for the world""...only as an excuse to belittle their work. Riley needs to learn what the word Intro...means in Intro to TV & Audio course
the best
a stud!
This is a guy where you will either love him or hate him. I did not like him what so ever.  Yes he can crack a joke, yes he knows what he is talking about when it comes to advertising. But he is a jerk. Telling students that their work is sh** and that we don't know anything.  If would help if he actually taught something once in a while.Avoid him!
not too bad.  doesnt use the book except for take home tests. just turn ur stuff in on time and u'll get an A. def tells it like it is.
Took his class years ago as non-traditional student. I was 29, returning from workforce & extremely focused. Maynard knows his stuff & conveys it well. However, he curses like a sailor & talks to everyone like they were morons. It's offensive & pointless. If not for his bitterness, I'd give him an A, but gave him C, instead.
Media Management. This class seems useless to me. We don't do anything with the book at all besides take home tests with it. Every day we listen to him tell us how miserable our lives are going to be. I'm not learning anything. The guest lectures are the only thing that save this class. He's also very unclear on assignments and the syllabus is vagu
I heard the bad stories as well however i enjoyed having him as a teacher...he taught me well and i loved it. I thank him for helping me through the department.
He made me cry the whole way home after my first day of his class. Basically he told us that in the comm. field we will be poor, and on top of that, losers! He also was more interested in talking about what he has done in life, than teaching us any material from the book. I didn't learn anything, except to never take his class again!
Riley is one of the best teachers ever...definitely take his classes, you'll learn alot.
A very bitter man. You'll never be inspired by him. Otherwise, an easy A if you turn in your stuff on time.
Riley is honest. That's why he uses the ""F"" word more than I do. As a teacher, he's one of the best I ever had.
ugh...half the class got 30somethingpercents on their midterm take home test because he was UNCLEAR now the best we can get are c's...
Great teacher if you were willing to work
Awesome teacher","A very bitter man. You'll never be inspired by him. Otherwise, an easy A if you turn in your stuff on time."
128,"Duff is fantastic. He's in my top 3 favorite professors of all time, no question. He grades fairly and gives good feedback, but make sure you know when things are due because he doesn't always remind you. Nothing was too challenging, though. Get ready for a fun, laid-back semester if Duff is on your schedule.
I have mixed feelings. Hes super funny, captivating, and outgoing. However, he is unorganized, a tough grader, and the assignment are not explained well at all. & he he seems to get aggravated when you email him about any questions,comments or concerns you may have. So my review is wishy-washy.
TAKE HIS CLASS. I took it as a major elective and it was so worth it. It is also the only class I've taken where I read the entire textbook and enjoyed every assignment. I wish I could have taken this seated, as it would have been even more enjoyable.
Duff is a fantastic professor. He personality that keeps class interesting. He doesn't like to use technology, so get ready to take notes during his lectures. Don't worry, he keeps them interesting. His assignments were very helpful in learning the material. The tests were hard and he gave a pretty vague study guide, but you can still do well.
If you are taking this class for theories (ACS 330) don't be nervous or scared. Make sure you study for the quizzes and read through the chapters. Heads up: MEMORIZE any lists of stuff that are mentioned in the book and he gives extra credit- always over NPR. Amazing teacher. He is genuine, honest, and inspiring. TAKE HIS CLASSES NOW!!
Best professor I have ever had at SIUE. Seriously, take him. Even if you are a biochemistry major, take him.
Listening class, over the summer. Of course, the material is compressed and you go over a lot in 5 weeks. Duff is a great guy, and he definitely has personality. Be prepared to take lots of notes during his lectures because that's where a lot of test questions come from. Speech Comm is my minor, so had to take this class, but he made it enjoyable.
Duff is one of the best instructors here! I love not only going to class but learning from him. He is helpful inside and outside the classroom. As long as you go and pay attention he is not to hard. Great professor!
He is a Great Professor! I learned more from him than anyone else in the department. He also inspired me to be a teacher of Communication.
Dr. Wrobbel keeps the class interesting. Lots of information given, much of it thought provoking.
By far the best professor I have ever had! I highly recommend taking Duff. His lectures can be boring, but it's college we're talking about. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to do well and improve. Loved him and wish he was my teacher for every class!!
this teacher had my attention since day one!! even if i was sick i would drive 30 minutes just to hear his lectures. his stories are always fun and he treats you like a person, not just some 'kid'. i highly recommend him as a teacher. his quizes consist of about 20 questions and if you read the chapters-they're an easy A.
Great teacher...Keeps you interested in subject and also makes you want to attend class. relates to us college students in a profound way. definitely recommend
By far one of the best teachers at siue..strucures the class so you will learn..not be stressed out with tedious assignments and actually relates subject to you and what youre going to personally be doing in life..could not reccomend more..great guy..TAKE HIM
He's entertaining in his lectures and very informative at the same time...very helpful, more than willing to help you understand the material and as long as you work hard, show up and participate, you'll do fine in his classes. Highly recommeneded!!
Duff. Is a great teacher. Class has taught me so so much. Thanks.
Interesting guy, I loved listening to his tangents, sometimes I thought he was having an acid flashback.  Highly intelligent man who made class interesting and was always helpful.  My only complaint would be that he was sometimes a little too political with his rants, even though he had some excellent points.
He loves to talk.  He doesn't seem like a hard test guy, but they can be.  He loves to make you learn a lot of lists for his tests.  Memorize all the lists and everything he tells you and you will do well.  Creates very comfortable atmosphere for students.
I had him several years ago, but he still stands out as the best professor I ever had.  Funny guy and he knows a lot about a lot.  It's unfortunate he doesn't teach anything in Mass Comm, because I'd take all his classes.","By far the best professor I have ever had! I highly recommend taking Duff.

131,"the material thought was very fulfilling information and he was an easy grader and due dates were very acceptable due dates    
Very knowledgeable. Dr. Grosse is extremely experienced and does his best to share his knowledge. He is always willing to help and often goes the extra mile.
not clear, condescending, and not organized
Difficult. he knows his****, but he's tough at times.
I had Dr. Grosse for Physics I and II labs and he was an excellent teacher.  He rides a bike to school every day, too.
He really wants to make you think and learn, not just spit back information.  He's a great guy who makes physics fun and worth all the work you have to put into the class.
Class & Lab is hard especially w/ him, but he's helpful and understanding if you go to him for help.
from an old alum... i credit dr. grosse with the reason i got my first job and still love working for the same company (for 12 years!).  like it or not those COBOL skills and his emphasis on 'work ethic' were key!...
The class isn't easy, but he's a great guy","He really wants to make you think and learn, not just spit back information.  He's a great guy who makes physics fun and worth all the work you have to put into the class."
132,"she is just too excited for it being 10 in the morning.
Nice Professor. Very open to alternative projects if you do not like essays. Had class outside once and brought up out to the campus garden. Grading is easy if you try and she will always proof read essays so you know what she wants.
Sachdev is absolutely wonderful, I cannot recommend her enough! She tries to make the readings as relatable as possible for her students and goes the extra mile to listen to what everyone has to say. She very clearly loves teaching and loves what she teaches, so if you're hunting for a professor who's dedicated to their craft, she's your gal.
Rachana knows how to make her class fun and interesting for everyone regardless of their major or background. She really strives to make everyone feel included and represented and ensures that everyone has a voice in the classroom. She tends to be a bit disorganized, but it's in a fun English teacher kind of way.
Class is long-winded and it's easy to doze- that's just the nature of it, though. Lots of reading but is all online. Requires you participate in discussion 2x per week (at least). Very caring, thoughtful, and a pretty decent professor.
I like this professor and I have had them for multiple classes, however, they often are hard to reach outside of class time. I enjoyed their courses but it was frustrating at times when you need clarification and you are unable to reach them.
Not a terrible class given it was Shakespeare & The Environment. Some participation is necessary. Not a heavy grader and is willing to work with you. However the class focused more on the environmental issues then Shakespeare.
I took Rachana's Asian Literature course and enjoyed her teaching style so much that I also took Shakespeare with her as an elective my senior year. Her classes are on the easier side, so as long as you do the readings and participate in group discussion you'll be fine.
Really lovely woman - she makes us cupcakes and is very nice. Everyone calls her by her first name. Super easygoing, doesn't care if you're late, barely cares if you did homework. You don't learn much and she gives everyone an A, so she's a real catch for requirement classes.
Impossible to know what she actually wanted. Very unclear with instructions.
I have Rachana for both of my honors classes this year, and I love her! She really gets you to think of the topic she approaches in a new and different way, as she is always willing to look over your papers and really help you out. She is one of the best teachers out there. 
Extremely easy grader. You watch a lot of films. The skits are hard only because people's schedules are so different, but really fun when actually performing. (No acting experience needed!!) Really fun teacher!
I'm very surprised to see so many low ratings.  I had Rachana for Shakespeare, and man was it fun!  (As a business major who hates Shakespeare, that says a lot.)  She was not a particularly hard grader, the skits/presentations were fun, and the field trip to D.C. was a blast.  Nothing funnier than Sachdev getting a little tipsy at dinner.
Thought & Civ was horrible. focused soley on the death penalty, all analysis of issue on her part was superficial. boring discussion, wasted paper with lots of readings, pointless trips (went to a prison & almost set off the alarms.) A lovely person outside the classroom, but avoid like the plague!
Had her for writing and thinking. She missed a total of 4/5 classes. Her grading system is horrible. You read 5 books then write essays on them. Essays arent hard. All you do is talk in class. Everyone has to volunteer or you will write essays. She is a nice teacher and all, but the class is very boring (also considering I had the class at 8 a.m.)
Dr. Sachdev is very disorganized, and gave me an 80 for class participation when I had attended more classes than she did. I learned some things in her class, but I honestly felt that her class was very dull. I would absolutely not recommend her.
Nice lady, very tough grader, very dull class
She has a great personality and is really interested in her students.  She has a great deal of knowledge and she is very accomidating.  I think she is a great professor and a wonderful person.
pointless class, horribly boring, and her grading system makes it very hard to do well.  also she grades very subjectively.
Do not take this lady.

137,"I went into professor Burnim's class with the expectation of learning a lot about Black Music, while still having a good time. I was gravely mistaken. She grades her papers incredibly difficultly, and her tests often have material that she barely, if at all covers. Steer clear of her. If your major makes you take her class CHANG YOUR MAJOR.
For a freshman level class, she's a very tough grader. Also, she doesn't answer your questions and is incredibly disorganized. 
I was looking forward to this class and was grossly disappointed. Her lecture information is poorly organized and difficult to follow. She doesn't know how to operate anything electronic including turning off caps lock. Her tone and mannerisms are abrasive and obnoxious. Expect to get a snarky response when you ask her to clarify herself and exams.
EXTREMELY BORING CLASS. also did not like the teacher at all.
Worst professor I have ever had. Doesn't listen to students at all. Thinks everything she says is great and useful (It isn't.) Very rude and doesn't return emails. Grading is absolutely ridiculous and she very opinionated and hard to deal with. She tries to be fun but her class is a bore and is terrible to sit through. I give her a huge F--
she plays favorites with students. She also tends to listen to students poorly - she makes a quick judgment about what you are saying and then doesn't listen to your whole idea. Very ethnusiastic though
mEAN
i did not enjoy the class
For a Doctor of Ethnomusicology, this woman seems to have an awfully difficult time operating a microphone.  Every day in class her voice was feeding back through the speakers, people were cringing, and guest performers were freaked out.  How do you think her fieldwork recordings sound?  ""Scree!!""
Leave her alone, she's a good professor with good intentions. She is very renowned in her area, but she expects you to do your work. This isn't a blow-off class, but it is as entertaining and fun as you make it. I was very satisfied with her class.
She cares about the students, but is offended too easily.  Her tests are suprisingly difficult as she throws out questions that are unfair without compensated the class with a curve.  All and all, I will stay away from the folklore department after this.
She seems nice, but she words her tests in a confusing manner and also sometimes messes up the correct information.  She does want students to do well though, but not many students actually do.
She's nice, but can get really hyper sometimes if she's had too much coffee. Yes, she loves her folklore/ethno students, but her courses are fun.
I agree. At first she seems nice but then you get to know her more. She is really annoying and favors certain students.",I was looking forward to this class and was grossly disappointed.

141,"Grades on class participation but argues any point you bring up making you not want to participate.Very combative. He is ALWAYS right.Comments on paper are not helpful.Not a good communicator of expectations on assignments. If you can get through all of that, there are moments when he says something profound.
I like to participate in class, but I thought the material was dry.  So sue me; I was bored!
Dr. Wardell receives so many negative comments because you actually have to engage and be participative in class. What a novel concept. The material I learned in his class nearly three years ago still has me thinking about labor theory, especially now that I'm in ""the real world."" He looks like Steve Martin but I don't think he's a Jerk.
I agree.  He'd probably be better off in Boone, NC.
While he bears a passing resemblence to Steve Martin, that is about the best thing I can say about him.  The term ""reprobate"" comes to mind.
Disgusting individual.
When we reflect back on our college experience, will we still think the material is ""dry"" after taking his class?  ZZZZZZZ
He embodies the ""Peter Principle"" to the maximum- he surpassed his level of competency several stages past. ""Those that can't do, teach....those that can't teach, become administrators!""
Dry material, Professor makes it fun. Dr. Wardell is about elevating one's ability to write and think. Read the readings, do the work, don't take the red markings personally and when you reflect back on your college experience, this class will stand out as one of the best.
I was in the IRHR Seminar nine years ago as a grad student.  Regardless of the comments of the genius below, ""Mark's"" class (known to most of us as Dr. Wardell) had an adversarial tone throughout, culminating in an interrogation/oral exam that felt more like retribution than any measure of knowledge.  We were only required to answer one question, and our answers were not evaluated but counted as ""participation"".  There was a meaningful written exam also.  A professor has to be willing to alter his teaching methods when things aren't working.
very helpful

142,"Overall, a pretty average class experience. The exams weren't terrible and there was not a crazy amount of work. Lectures definitely get boring and attendance is mandatory if you want the notes, but I have definitely had worse. 
13 min 25 questions and questions from out-class reading and 4 or more 30+ pages PPTs.
Attendance is mandatory, must go to get the blanks to slides which will be what is on exams. Exams open note but the class average was often still a C or low B, must have a good note sheet to do well. Does not provide missing work for almost any reason. Hard grader, very nit picky. Do not go on your phone in class, will get mad. No textbooks needed
Dr. Clark is by no means a great professor. His lectures are difficult to listen to, as he just drones on for the whole class. You will never get out of class early. Attendance is graded daily through tophat. He is not an understanding guy, but his TA was. All assignments are due at the beginning of class, and are not open for late submission.
I did not think Professor Clark cares about students at all. I think he approaches teaching like a chore.
Very nitpicking grading on assignments where he will take a point off for little things. Exams are very straight forward as questions are straight from the slides. Must show up to class to get participation and slide blanks.
Professor Clark was easily my favorite professor this semester. The notes are PowerPoint slides that you fill in the blank. Taking notes, doing the readings, and studying, will make this class easy.
There are other sections of ler 100 that you can take instead. I dont think hell be winning any teaching awards any time soon
The tests contain information that was clearly laid out in the powerpoints we fill out in class. If you don't come to class, you will miss the ""blanks"" he has in the powerpoints so you will miss out on info that could be on an exam. Just pay attention in lectures, do the TopHat questions, and study good before exams and you will earn a good grade.
The class is boring but the Professor could make it more interesting if he put in more effort. All the examples he uses and all the activities seem really dated. Not the worse professor by any stretch but maybe average or below average.
His tests are straight forward, but often tricky. The classes are really boring, but you have to attend because of clicker (that sometimes he doesn't even give). No extra credit whatsoever. He does not seem to care about his students as people, simply as numbers who are in class. Overall easy class, but would not take it again.
Tests are very straight forward, all the information comes from the slides and some from the reading. I never felt surprised by a question on the tests. He is very caring and funny. There is a lot of assignments, but the readings are usually interesting articles from New York Times or something like that. Lecture can be boring a lot though.
Pretty dry lectures, but if you go to class and study the powerpoint slides (which he now posts on Canvas for his students), you'll be fine. Do the readings; first test really didn't have much from the readings, but after that they start appearing. Just skim them for the important details that he repeats in class!!
Dr. Clark is a decent guy, other than you can definitely feel that he sees you as a number and not a student. Despite me having doctor's notes for absences and explaining my personal situation, he actually got mad and wasn't very available. TA does most. Class isn't hard but not very easy either. Just make sure to do the occasional assignment.
Dr. Clark is the type of professor that you want for a class like this. Most of the material is relatively dry and uninteresting(unless this is your major) but Dr. Clark goes out of his way to keep lectures intriguing. Advice: The first exam is the easiest so DO NOT blow off the others, don't miss class unless you have too, take solid notes.
This class was amazing. It's very interesting and Prof. Clark really cares about his students doing well. There's a lot of reading, but he provides you with the articles and they're not that difficult. His tests are straightforward, but a good deal of the questions come from the readings. You have to study to do well, but he's very fair.
Dr. Clark has to be the most chill prof. here! Exam questions come straight from his lecture slides to come to class (he doesn't post them online). No textbook, uses clickers for participation points, 2 articles on any event related to the course material, and 6 activities (some in groups some individual). Really easy gen ed if you need one!
Case studies are interactive with active business strategies. Good choices of case studies and the transition between the text book and case studies is apt.
He has clear powerpoint presentations so it is easy to understand class. He wants clickers to get attendance which are important so be sure to have one friend in the class in any case. 
Prof. Clark is the MAN!!! I don't know how people average B's on the tests. If you read the articles (total of like 6 pages) and are half alive in class, it's an easy A. Group projects can screw you over if you have a terrible group. Clark is also e the most hilarious people you will ever meet. Take this guy if you go to Penn State.","Overall, a pretty average class experience. The exams weren't terrible and there was not a crazy amount of work. Lectures definitely get boring and attendance is mandatory if you want the notes, but I have definitely had worse. "
147,"As a freshman at Kenyon in 1984, I took Mr. Lentz's literature class. I graduated from law school, was elected a prosecutor in Montana shortly thereafter, worked as a prosecutor in New Mexico, in the financial industry in Singapore, and to this day, I find Mr. Lentz's class one of the most relevant classes I ever took even though, unfortunately I
I took this class 7 years ago but I still remember that he made me cry. We had ""recitations"" (short, a handwritten page, answers to prompts on the text we're reading) and he said I should withdraw from the class because I did poorly on 1! Otherwise averaging a B/B+. He may be the reason I dislike early American Lit (in grad school for Lit).
Simply the best professor I have ever had.  His 50 minute lectures are phenomenal and his knowledge of the subject matter is both encyclopedic and still growing.  He insists on 2 things-punctuality and familiarity with the assignment.  If you cannot do the reading and show up on time do not take his class.  If you can, then do.
It turns out that the ""Charles P. McIlvaine Professor of English"" isn't even up to date on literary criticism in his field. His lectures are informed by some scholars who were prominent in the late sixties. UGH!!He's a kind man though.
He is a wonderful professor. I took his american lit class. It is challenging and some of the books we read weren't my favorite, but he is great! He is one of the kindest people I have ever met. It is annoying that his office hours are really early in the morning, but you should go anyway.
No! Just No!!!! Thanks God he's retiring. His new book is a catastrophe on paperback, too. People should realize that big words don't make a good teacher.
A truly devoted professor and wonderful mentor. He lives and breathes literature, and he really inspires his students to work hard and react personally to the text. Kind, perceptive, and invested in his students. If you want a challenging but fulfilling English experience, take a class with him. It's so sad that he's only here for one more year!
You either love him or you hate him. No inbetweens. I LOVE HIM! Amazing professor and human being.
I admit I'm rather baffled by all these accusations of misogyny. Mr. Lentz has thus far always treated my as a complete equal. He's an absolutely extraordinary lecturer and has always made time for me in his office hours as well, whether to discuss the text or just to talk over whatever I've been reading on my own.
Bombastic, but delightfully so. Demands a great deal of writing, which is not graded especially hard. He treats students fairly enough. I do wonder whether he is a competent teach of poetry. He reads Milton as if it were written in prose, adding extra syllables every so often.
If you are a wishy washy, backboneless english student who likes to ""feel"" instead of know, don't take him.  If you have the wherewithal to withstand his staunch criticism of your work, if you would like to know the pillars of modern literature, if you want to experience the best English teacher i have ever had, if you want excellence, take Lentz.
He taught me how to complete a sentence. Yeah, he's religious, yeah, it's the canon. But, who teaches the canon better than Lentz, and don't you think you should read it well before you discount it. He is also the most compassionate, generous professor I've ever had. He grades hard, but on terms you set forth in writing
Those who slander Mr. Lentz appear to not have listened to his CRYSTAL CLEAR eplanations in the syllabus and the ENDLESS AMOUNTS of respect he gives his students. Despite his old-fashioned approach and occasional abrassiveness, one can learn a lot from Lentz.
extremely tyrannical in his teaching style and seems to like prostelitizing more than discussing topics from the readings. all i learned from his course was about the kenyon college plagarism conduct
If you like misogyny, you'll love Lentz. He soured me on the English department as a whole and on English as a subject. He should have retired years ago and been a Civil War historian instead.
Mr. Lentz is legendary for a reason.  He rereads the novels he assigns along with you and is always open to new interpretations.  If you don't learn something about life from him, you aren't paying attention.
He is great
Lentz is completely old school.  He won't allow you to make up a quiz for being two minutes late and then he'll hold you four minutes after class.  His rigidness is often unfair and tyrannical
His intellectual capability is staggering, but that doesn't translate into a good course.  The readings he assigns, though essential, are tired and trite.  His clarity is renowned, but what he chooses to cover is well worn material.
A fantastic professor. The best lecturer I've ever had. The classes on Moby Dick were amazing, ditto Red Badge of Courage and the Henry James novel at the end. Kenyonites, TAKE HIS CLASS!","A truly devoted professor and wonderful mentor. He lives and breathes literature, and he really inspires his students to work hard and react personally to the text.

150,"okay. nothing special, really boring class. hoping to get a B. she is dry but nice. final is not cumulative.
An intelligent lady, absolutely no idea how to teach the material. Whatever you do, do not take her.
Prof. Levenburg is a very tough grader. She graded every sentences of your analysis and offered a 2-page feedback. Extra credit of 30 points were given. Besides being a very tough grader, she cared about her students and their learning progress. She encouraged participation and also student interaction in the class. Study well then you will pass!
She doesn't teach the material that is in the homework, or does simplified versions that are not helpful to learning the difficult material. She taught multiple concepts blatantly wrong. She gives rude responses to reasonable questions from students. Her lectures are ineffective at teaching the concepts and often focus on irrelevant material.
She was the most inefficient prof ive ever had. She'll ask if she should switch between whiteboard/ projector/computer about 15 times every class and wont even listen when you answer her. She constantly asks if we have questions but then DOESNT EVEN LOOK UP TO SEE IF YOU RAISE YOUR HAND! She even goes through half a math prob and just stops
No matter who you take 1. MGT 366 is a hard class 2. There's no easy A. Putting aside she makes you feel dumb, there are good things about her class. She gives a lot of extra credit, tells you exactly what math problems will be on the exam (crucial, some teachers dont) and gives you a ""help sheet"" on exams. She makes sure you know the material tho.
DO NOT TAKE HER. She made her tests incredible hard and no one finished them on time. One time she even left the class with 10 people still taking the exam and we all had to chase her up to her office to hand it in. She gets distracted easily and lectures are her reading the powerpoint... which she goes too fast on so you cant even take notes on.
I can honestly say she is one of the worst professors I've ever had. Her methods of teaching in class are sub par and do not prepare you for the overly packed exams she gives. She's very vague in her explanations and passive aggressive. Do not take her for any class. Also, be very thorough with everything that has to do with the plant tour.
She is very nice at appearance, but is not very understanding with students. If you ask a question her response is always very passive aggressive. Homework you grade yourself, quizzes are online, so you really get nailed on exams and the plant tour project. Shes very critical of your plant tour charter, benchmark questions, and written report.
Terrible Professor!!! I have had not problem in excelling in school throughout my years at GVSU, and she put a halt to that. I would advise anyone and everyone to never take her!!! The worst professor I have ever had!!!!
Prof Levenburg was one of my favorite profs I've had at GV. She's quirky and funny, and explains everything we need to know in great detail. I was originally dreading this class but it ended up being my favorite of the semester. Also gives 30 points extra credit. Would highly recommend her and this class!!!
90% of your grade relies on a plan tour project and 3 exams but does allow an 8.5X11 sheet for help. Exams are very math oriented but wasn't too bad. Forget about learning from her, she will just read slides and then jumps into problems without any explanation. (Watch Youtube Vids). She grades as if this is a SWS class. Take a different Prof!
Professor Levenburg is a very smart person, but not a good professor at all. This is my first time ever writing a review in my four years at Grand Valley. She is a professor who is relatively easy but not worth taking. She is disrespectful to her students when they ask a simple question. Constantly makes mistakes when going over examples, no good.
Professor Levenburg is the worst professor I have had at Grand Valley. I learned absolutely nothing from her class besides how to deal with a rude, negative professor that does not care for her students. Do yourself a favor and take a different professor.
Lots of opportunities for extra credit (up to 30 points), you get an 8x11 cheat sheet  on each exam and she gives partial credit. For the plant tour project, make sure your group has the best report or you will not do well. My group was marked down for things that were not in the rubric. Lots of homework and quizzes, but only 5 out of 8 count.
She will read directly from the book with no added clarity. Difficult exams. Will not give you enough time to take exams. Have a question? Read the rubric, she won't help you. If you do not do projects exactly the way she wants them done, she will torch your grade. Unimaginative, uninspiring, just plain ""un."" Worst instructor I've ever had.
Pretty good teacher, exams are exam plus you get a cheat sheet. Go to class and study for the exam easy B or A if you try.
Professor Levenburg was awesome. She does this thing called ""mulligans"" which is basically just free points for participating in class to get back on the exam. Whenever I had questions, she was always able to answer them. Attend class, keep up on homework, and you'll be fine. Do the review packets she gives & tests are super easy! Would take again!
She is a tough prof but genuinely cares about her students. Very much a part of my college experience. She is sweet and smart. She has always been willing to talk with me and help. Very quick to respond to emails and blackboard. Great instructor!
Tough class. Only 3 exams, first and last are 25% of your grade and the middle is worth 40%. Homework is assigned every night excluding exam days, she takes the best 5 out of 7-9 she collects, and they are collectively worth 10% of your grade. Good, but difficult teacher. Most likely lost my 4.0 at Seidman with an A-...","Professor Levenburg is a very smart person, but not a good professor at all.

151,"The best professor ever! If I would have a chance I will take him for all my classes. He is the only professor that take care of students. He always teach so clear and gives you a lot of explanations. I recommend to you all, Respect!!
Dr. Good has a great personality and has 2 tests, 1 phone call, and 1 presentation. It is very manageable, and I recommend taking MKT 356 !
Nice, funny guy.  A bit odd but easy to listen to.  He has some sales experience and know how to teach it, but its his way or the highway, and there are 100 ways to sell.  Overall fun useful class.  Recommend
I had him for MKT 356 and 451... you learn a lot from his lectures but his tests are mainly based from the book, which is why they are so rough!!! Overall one of the best professors I've had @ GV!!!!
Professor Good is a great teacher, in fact one of the best at GVSU. He is very laid back, but is willing to help with problems. He leaves assignments a little vague, so it makes class tough. He does this on purpose though to make you work, and it really helps you learn. Take this class, you will learn a lot.
One of the best prof's at GV- I made sure to have him 2 more times next semester! very funny, interactive and keeps you attentive. Sales presentation isn't as bad as it seems, exams are not too bad (take online practice exams!)
Dr. Good is a realy great proffessor. He really wants his students to do well in his class. Make sure you read the book and his powerpoints. The test weren't too difficult just make sure you read. Studying the powerpoints alone won't get you a good grade. Overall a great prof!
Dr. Good is a great professor.  He's hilarious, and always gives notes based on what you need to know, not every minute detail in chapters. The course requires a lot of individual studying for the exams, and the project is a BIG part of the grade, but overall the class was enjoyable and fun.  DO NOT TAKE IF YOU CAN'T DO AN INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATION.
This guy is one of the top professors at GVSU.  Doesn't even need any aids to help him present the material. Great personality and fun guy to work with.  He is demanding of students (don't miss any classes) but the landed benefit of having taken him for this capstone is well worth it!
He is a great teacher, helpful, and very nice, always in a good mood and will make you laugh. His tests are pretty tricky so study, the sales call and presentation make sure you know your product well and youll do fine. Dont be afraid to close when he says sounds good, and if he says i have to think about it ask him what there is to think about.
Amazing professor. Couldn't be better! 356 was an amazing class, so I took Good for 456, and I liked him just as much, if not better. Take him for any class that you can. He is an asset to GV and he loves his students. Really fun. Easy. Fun!!
nice guy. great friend. teaches well, however is somewhat difficult. HE EXPECTS A LOT FROM HIS STUDENTS! go to class prepared and ready to learn and participate. he calls on people a lot. uses powerpoint. tests are multiple choice. good class, but expects a lot. no homework at all-just 2 tests and the sales presentation, thats it.
very, very nice guy. hard though. study your BUTT OFF. not afraid to fail people on the midterm, but helps them along with easier grading on the project and final.  lots of work but you learn alot and it is a capstone. so what do u expect i guess? he's a morning person. so if you're not; avoid the 8:30 start like i had. and dont be late to class.
He's my favorite professor at Grand Valley.  I have called him for life advice since I have completed his classes.  Great guy and great professor.  I learned a great deal and took a lot from his lectures/discussions.  BE PREPARED to ASK for the SALE!
One of the best professors I've had at GVSU.  I'm an accounting major and took the class just because I need a business elective that fit my schedule.  Still this was a great class that I learned so much from.  I would recomend any business students take one of his classes before they graduate.
This professor is EXCELLENT!!! If you have a chance to take him, DO NOT HESITATE!
I had Dr. Good for three classes at GVSU.  Great professor.  READ THE BOOK! and you'll do alright, attendance is key!  Highly recommended
Great prof, extremely knowledgeable about sales. Fun class, study terms in book and power point and you will do fine. Def take him for MKT 356!
This class was really hard for me. The tests were brutal but the project (even though it took forever) wasnt too bad. Make sure you choose a good group for the project! Dave is very, very clear and interesting. I never fell asleep once. Great Prof, just hard class sometimes.
Great guy! Makes the class interesting. If you read the book the tests are super easy.  Come to class and utilize what he says and the sales presentation will go fine! Great prof, i would recommend him to anyone! marketing major or not!",Dr. Good is a realy great proffessor. He really wants his students to do well in his class. Make sure you read the book and his powerpoints. The test weren't too difficult just make sure you read. Studying the powerpoints alone won't get you a good grade. Overall a great prof!
152,"Not a very good instructor.  Exams were curved anywhere from 8 to 10 percentage points just to get the exam average around a 78%.  For a group of students to produce results around a 70% average just reflects how well the course was being taught.  I would avoid him
He is not the worst teacher, nor is his class the hardest. That being said it is a difficult class and he is a tough professor. Decent effort could get you a A or a C depending on the person. If you get below a C then you should major outside of business.
Went to class everyday and put more work into his class than any other for the semester. Also studied a lot and still got a C.
Good students can go to class everyday, put in a lot of effort, study and still not do well. Last semester was bad. Simply put, the class is very challenging. Brewer knows his stuff and is nice, but I would avoid if possible. He curves to reach a C grade distribution.
Very difficult class, however Brewer taught the very simply.  The problems he did every day showed up on the 3 tests.  Come to class, take notes and go to to his office and you get a good grade
Everyone was hatin on this dude but forreal ACC 222 wasn't that bad that semester.  If you never went to an econ class and tried to learn everything 2 days before the exam you would've done terribly as well
DO NOT TAKE BREWER!!!!!! I have no idea why there are so many smiley faces for this man. Basically my entire semester consisted of studying for accounting 202. His class was impossible. His tests are outrageously hard especially if you're not an accounting major. RUN FROM THIS MAN!
Dr. Brewer was a horrible teacher. He just did practice problems in class. Exams were 100x more difficult than those problems.  Had very low test average but did have a ~10% curve. Do not take this class with him!!!!! If anything, take it in the summer!
the most important thing about this is class is to stay caught up with the material! do not try to learn everything a few days before the test. and try to stick it out until the end because the final really wasn't that bad.
Dr. Brewer is a brilliant man. He can teach you a lot and he is nice. His class is very challenging and his exams are difficult. You have to pay attention and study a ton to do decent. As stated in a previous comment by another student, a huge number drop and/or struggle with his class.
Dr. Brewer is a really nice guy but his tests are very challenging. Good students still may not do well. His exam averages are in the 50's most of the time and a lot of students drop his class. He does have great knowledge of the subject though.
He is really nice guy and keep his course at a high standard level. His lecture is very clear and helpful. If you keep track of his lecture and keep practicing problems you will get a good grade! His class is definitely important if you are accounting major or want to know about accounting more deeply.
i got an A+ in ACC 221 and it all made complete sense to me. just finished the first exam in 222 and it was probably the hardest test i have ever taken!!! i did all the online homework, went to class, and studied a ton too!!
Best accounting professor I've ever had. Many of students said his exams are impossible. But to me, once you attend and participate his classes well, you can handle the exams. And he has a nice curve policy. TAKE HIS CLASS!
By far the best accounting professor I've had at Miami.  Dr. Brewer cares about his students and wants everyone to do well.  He has a good method of teaching -- going over cases and lots of practice problems before the exams. Exams are definitely difficult but not the end of the world.  I learned more in his class than any other class in college.
He is the best ACC professor ever. His class time is quite challenging but efficient and really helpful for studying. His test is not so hard if you follow him during class and finish his practice problems before exams.
In my opinion, the best accounting professor.
his class was ridiculously hard and impossible.
hardest prof ever. I studied so hard and I got a 40% on the first exam, went into office hours and the man comparded accounting to golf. No matter how hard and how many times he plays golf, hell never be tiger woods...basically youre not gonnna get a hole in one!! DONT TAKE HIM YOU CAN HELP IT
Dr.Brewer is a great professor who cares about all of his students. For 333, there was no homework but you better be prepared for the participation and attendance grade. The tests were somewhat difficult but doable. Dr. Brewer is very friendly and approachable. I highly recommend him for this class.",Dr. Brewer is a really nice guy but his tests are very challenging. Good students still may not do well. His exam averages are in the 50's most of the time and a lot of students drop his class. He does have great knowledge of the subject though.
154,"P. Salzarulo is a nice guy, but that's his only redeeming quality. This dude couldn't lecture to save his life. 90% of the class material must be taught to yourself. The class is still super easy, but don't expect much help from the prof. ADV Project is an insane amount of work that is worth just enough that if you don't do it, you will fail.
Dr. Salzarulo is very caring and flexible! The class was not that difficult and he made sure that students understood the material. 100% recommend!
Salzarulo may be one of the best instructors I've had in my academic career. MGT 302 normally isn't a difficult class, but Salzarulo makes it a total breeze. Mini exams each week over one chapter's worth of content. They make up 70% of your grade. 15% is participation and 15% is homework. You absolutely MUST show up to class each day to do well.
Overall good professor. He has the class set up as each week you take a ""mini-exam"". This is a game-changer because it substitutes taking one big final exam. Just take good notes and read the chapters and you should be solid!
Class is broken up into 10 or so mini-exams which, with a couple homework's, make up all of your grade. As long as you stay up to date for the mini exams, the class isn't too difficult. Salzarulo is funny and entertaining during lectures and uses a lot of real life examples which can help to understand some of the more boring course content.
Amazing class, amazing professor. He does weekly ""mini-exams"" rather than your typical exams. This means you only have to study one chapter per week, and not stress about a huge exam. Lectures are great and he constantly uses real-world examples. Very caring and funny and does what he can for you to get an A. Highly recommend Professor Salzarulo.
Good class, never less he could go a little bit deeper into the materia. But the fact, that he tells stories about the real professional live, gives you a good look regarding to your professional live.
I. Love. Dr. Salzarulo. Lectures are straight to the point and he provides a lot of insight through (surprisingly interesting) real-world applications. He does mini-exams once a week over one chapter, which is so much easier to retain than through exams over many chapters. I loved this class and it inspired me to get a supply chain minor.
Dr. Salzarulo is one of my most memorable profs during my four years. He taught with respect and thorough explanation of topics while not wasting time. I wished I was a supply chain major so I could learn more from him.
No exams! Only super-quizzes each week. However, don't do what I did and treat them like quizzes and not study for them. Its a nice change from going from exams that you cram for to just doing one chapter quizzes. Only graded by those quizzes and the couple of homeworks you have.
Pete is the absolute man, he is 100% the teacher you should take for Supply Chain Management. While his tests are hard he does a great job of preparing you for them. He also has great real world experience which he applies to the course material to help you better understand it.
Probably the best teacher you can take for this course. Thoroughly explains theories and uses great examples. He really cares about his students and is overall a very effective teacher for a not so exciting topic!
He is very passionate about what he teaches and will go out of his way to help you understand difficult concepts. Take him for 302! Exam wise, fluctuates between semi-easy to hard-you need to pay attention in class to fully understand concepts. Don't buy the book!
Pete is an all-around great guy.  This course was extremely straightforward- read the textbook now and then, listen to the lectures, and study a bit, and you're set for an A.  Pete wants everyone to do well, and he makes class interesting with stories.  Loved this class!
One of my favorite professors at Miami thus far. Tests are pretty much straight from lecture/powerpoints. Tests can be challenging, so go to class and take notes. Great fun and great guy.
Peter Anthony Salzarulo - MGT 302. Really good professor, would take another course taught by him.  Tests are straightforward from lectures and powerpoint slides.  Explains concepts clearly is always willing to stop and answer questions. Advice: go to the textbook website and do practice quizzes.
Different from the OTHER Salzarulo...good guy, makes class interesting, always has good current events/videos to show in class, tests are tricky, def need to come to class & take notes!! overall great guy!
good prof.  He is new and is also a townie from back in the day.  Lot of fun to mess around with
Very tough course regardless who teaches it.","I. Love. Dr. Salzarulo. Lectures are straight to the point and he provides a lot of insight through (surprisingly interesting) real-world applications.

157,"This woman is the absolute worst when it comes to teaching math. The class is very easy with literally any other professor at GVSU, but Tami Bailey makes it a nightmare. She speeds through the lecture, and does not care to explain anything she is writing then assigns unrelated readings, hands out random packets, and won't help with questions. Awful
She is a very nice person but not the best teacher. My strongest subject is math and I struggled slightly in this class due to her teaching style. You can look up videos on YouTube or Khan Academy to help you, so if you have that kind of time, it's not too bad. Pop quizzes every Friday.
Professor Bailey is extremely nice, but is not the best teacher. Pop quiz on most Fridays, but they weren't too difficult. She went much faster than any other professor I have which made the material confusing. This is the first algebra class I haven't gotten an A in. 
Prof Bailey does not know how to teach. We ask for help in class and she tells us she doesn't know and we should go to the math tutoring center instead. She grades test and quizzes very heavily and it's the only thing you're graded on. She assumes we know what she's doing on the board with no extra explanation. I do not recommend her as a prof.
She's super nice, but she is one of the worst professors I've ever had. Expect to learn the ENTIRE class's material yourself, she's basically useless. Avoid this class.
Bailey is the most unorganized and confusing professor I have ever had. I do not recommend her for any class. I have had to take her 2 times for Algebra and Trig. This is the worst professor I have run into. She cares about students but the class is pure chaos and does not make any sense. I had to teach myself the entire class in order to pass.
Professor Bailey is a nice lady but horrible at teaching. She would go over the example problems so fast and would stand right in front of the board so you couldn't see what she was doing. She never actually taught in class, just expects you to learn everything from the book and hopes you know what you are doing in the end. Definitely stay away!!!!
Prof. Bailey is a very kind lady and always encouraged us to ask questions. I really appreciated all the time she would use for going over homework if we needed it. However, as someone who was a good math student in high school, I kinda struggled to understand a lot of things in this class. She wasn't the greatest at actually teaching the material.
Professor Bailey is an extremely kind woman. She is very caring and understanding- responds quickly and truly wants to get to know her students even in an online setting. It helps to get to know her in return, she will help whenever she can if she feels you are really trying. The content can be difficult and you teach yourself sometimes!
Prof Bailey is a sweet woman but online isn't her strong suit. The class often had to teach ourselves (this is trig, too). Doesn't teach very well in an online setting.
Would not recommend taking her. i took trig online w her and was lost the entire time. only does examples very fast in lecture and never explains concepts ever. when someone asks her to explain something she does it in a very confusing way and struggles sometimes. take someone else if you can
Prof Bailey is great she struggled with technology at first but got the hang of it. She is super helpful and I really liked her class! I would take again!
Very unorganized class, very nitpicky grader and expectations are very unclear. Prepare to spend more time finding her assignments than actually doing them, and don't expect quick responses on questions, because she doesn't respond for at least 24 hours.
A lot of work went into earning my A, but I have to say she is a great and caring professor. I'm terrrrrrible at math and still earned an A. She will go over all your homework questions if you ask. Quizzes every Friday are rough but they help!
Prof. Bailey is super sweet and really cares about her students. She will answer ANY math question you have and is quick to respond to emails. She's a super quick grader which is great because I'm always anxious to know my test scores, and in her class they were always good because her tests are very fair. She tells you what will be on them.
Tami is so sweet! Her class is more of group-based learning, so it is kind of a learns it yourself, class. If you're familiar with the content the class isn't hard. If you need help with anything she is always more than welcome to help you. Again, it is group-based so make sure you like the people you sit with! Overall, a kind teacher.
Prof Bailey is very nice and helpful if you ask. I definitely recommend going to her office hours if you are struggling because she will help you with whatever you dont understand. The first 2 weeks of the class are definitely the hardest, so if you can make it through those weeks then you should be fine :) Also pop quizzes once a week.
Doesn't put grades in quickly so I had a C for most of the semester but other than that she's a good teacher but better 1-on-1. I learn better when they explain step by step but she usually just wrote the problem out and then barely explained after. She constantly has office hours so if you're struggling she's available for help. very nice woman.
she is the sweetest woman on the planet, she's the reason I like math! definitely taking her again!!! if you have the chance to go to her office hours there is no way you could get a low grade. she wants everyone to do well and is always available after class.
She gives you like 1 example during lecture and expects you to be able to figure out the rest of the homework that she doesnt cover, on your own. She also doesnt give extra credit so basically if you are failing you're screwed.","Prof Bailey is a sweet woman but online isn't her strong suit. The class often had to teach ourselves (this is trig, too). Doesn't teach very well in an online setting."
158,"He retired after this semester, respect
So cool
Prof Ferguson is definitely a person I look up to. I had the best connection with him out of all of my professors I've had in the engineering course so far. He makes somewhat uninteresting topics lively and fun and is great at explaining tough concepts. Definitely attend office hours and introduce yourself. Good luck on your next adventure!
CIS 163 was a blast with Ferguson. He made every lecture interesting and you could tell that he has had quite a lot of experience in the industry. If you are already passionate about learning programming, then this class will supercharge you! On the other hand, if you struggle with programming concepts, It will definitely be a challenge.
First of all, Professor Ferguson is not a very organized person, so it is kind of a mess taking his class online, but he is a good teacher and I enjoyed his class. But at the same time, his projects are all pretty long and the final exam was unnecessarily long and hard. So my advice is that take his class in person.
Ferguson is just all around a great guy. He is very honest in his feedback and WILL tell you his opinion, no sugar-coating. He is very helpful in office hours and will work with you until you understand the material. He is extremely smart and knows what he's talking about. Very good prof for CIS 163. Wish I could have him for future classes :(
Dr. Ferguson's class was one of the best I have had. Even though I received a B, I can say that I had a lot of fun taking his class. He prioritizes Projects and Tests as these are pretty much your whole grade. If you do take his class expect to put in around 8-10 hours a week on projects. You will not regret taking his class!
Dr. Ferguson is an amazing prof for CIS163. He really cares that students understand the material and gives a decent amount of help on the projects. This class is a ton of hard work but Ferguson makes it better and is somewhat understanding with grades. His lectures are easy to understand and engaging.
He is very caring and he wants his students to succeed! You can go to his office for hours on end if you need help with a project or just want to talk. He will make sure you understand the content. The book is used in class to show examples! There are 4 projects, midterm and final. You HAVE to work hard to get a good grade but he will help you.
Best professor you will ever have. Do what you can to get in this guys class!!
He is an awesome professor very knowledgeable about computer science. The class is 4 projects which he helps you out on through the course in lecture. Also gives you VERY helpful hints if you go to office hours. He will tell you everything on the midterm, lab exam, and final but you still need to study for those because it is not an easy class.
Dr Ferguson is without a doubt one of Grand Valley State Universitys finest. He puts genuine effort into assuring the success of his students, but also doesnt sugar coat anything and will tell you like it is. His teaching style is understandable and effective, and truly prepares you before entering the real world. The class was structured great.
Prof Ferguson is certainly one of the best at grand valley if not the best in the CS department. He is extremely caring of his students and wants all of them to leave his class not just beater coders but more prepared for the workplace in general. He is very clear with projects and exams and is always ready to help with anything.
Cool dude thats really passionate and experienced in programming. He wants to make sure his students are well prepared and successful.
We had 4 projects, a midterm, and a final. We didn't use the book much. Ferguson makes you work for your grade, but you come out of his class far better off because of it. It's not the easiest class, but the quality is extremely high, and his lectures and humor are fantastic. An absolutely fantastic professor overall, would absolutely take again.
Overall Ferguson teaches the class really well and does a great job making sure students learn and understand the material. The projects can be challenging and he usually has fairly high standards for them, but isnt clear with what he wants you to do on them at times. He was always available for help before/after class and during his office hours.
Professor Ferguson is AMAZING. You can DEFINITELY tell that he cares for his students and gives it his all. In his lecture you don't just learn how to code, but also how function out there in the real world. For sure my favorite professor so far.
Hilarious, gives great lectures, understanding of student's having other classes, very knowledgeable, helpful one-on-one or in class. Tends to move through material very quickly but is prepared to slow down or repeat himself so long as you're willing to speak up. Easy grader and cares about his students and their understanding. Great Prof!
Very fast paced. The book is used often, though I somehow survived without it. Assignments are all projects, the difficulty of each one scales. He obviously cares about what he does, and offers help to anyone who wants it, and is willing to put in the effort.
Good Teacher. Very Knowledgeable and knows how to break things down to a level anyone can understand.",Dr. Ferguson is an amazing prof for CIS163. He really cares that students understand the material and gives a decent amount of help on the projects. This class is a ton of hard work but Ferguson makes it better and is somewhat understanding with grades. His lectures are easy to understand and engaging.
163,"Shows favoritism. NO clear consistency in grading.
This professor should be fired.  She shows so much favoritism it's wrong. She's hung up on all the small details and was 5 weeks behind for path.
Gret prof, she is helpful and a good person!
Very hard but you learn so much!!
Terry on the outside seems like a helpfull person, but do not trust her.  She will stab you in the back faster than a NY minute.  She is a power ****, and not a happy person.
Best teacher ever!
Smartest woman I've ever met, but treats you with great respect still",Very hard but you learn so much!!
164,"Would take class again, best professor at GVSU
funny guy; likes to talk about nipples (in a totally anatomical way, of course)
Very serious..., always. Extremely intelligent, I think he knows every cell and its location in the body. Very organized.
tests are damn hard even when you know the material.  but makes lectures interesting.
Very smart man, lectures are interesting.  Don't ask him for any help because he won't give you any.  Know EVERYTHING for the tests!!
The class was harder than expected, but his lectures were always interesting. He is funny.
Best Professor I've had at GVSU.  His tests are easy if you know your information.  Very intelligent man, and is willing to help if you ask for it.  He will be missed greatly in anatomy land!!!
Smart man.  Knows what he is talking about.  You need to study a lot to do good in the class.
hard exams, but he can be fun
Good prof.Knows notes VERY well! Willing to help, but arrogant about it.
very hard class. Always so SERIOUS. If you dont have any background in anatomy don't plan on passing.
You cannot pass!
he is very intelligent, but is arrogant about it.  Talks to you in a  you're such an idiot  tone when answering your question.
If you love arrogance, you hit the jackpot
Snobby and Jerkish, but hey, thats the way all british people are
Best professor at GVSU.
Very hard tests, hard to understand,and wears annoyingly tight jeans","Very smart man, lectures are interesting.  Don't ask him for any help because he won't give you any.  Know EVERYTHING for the tests!!"
165,"She went out of her way to embarrass students for dumb things like being late on the first day & going to the bathroom, myself included. Class atmosphere was uncomfortable. She is slow to post grades. I've never met such a two-faced professor. Glad she's retiring so I don't have to see her. I haven't disliked a teacher so much since middle school.
When you aren't particularly gifted at math, a good teacher can make all the difference. Professor Fackler is not that teacher. Her tests were hard for a gen ed math credit & her personality is akin to professor Umbridge from Harry Potter. If you are great at math you'll be okay but don't take her if not. You will be belittled for asking questions.
I loved Professor Fackler! Although she is retiring and will no longer be at Grand Valley she was still an amazing professor.  Professor Fackler was incredibly clear and had answers for all questions.  She really understood her students thinking process.
Tish was awesome. I had her for 110 and 122. I hated math before her classes, but now I don't mind it at all. She is a tough grader, but that helps you in the long run. She's super funny and nice, and I am sad this is her last semester. Overall, I would recommend her to everyone if she was going to be here another semester.   Thanks Tish! :)
I saw her go out of her way a couple times to humiliate students.  It seemed sort of weird and immature.  Other than that, she's just okay--not great.  I wouldn't take her again.
ALWAYS show every bit of your work on quizzes or you won't get full credit. She's great if she likes you, but don't get on her bad side. Do the assigned homework and you will pass with ease.
Prof Fackler was great! She would stop and clarify anything that you may have a question on and her office hours were always open to anyone who needed a little more help! I would recommend her to anyone who doesn't really understand Math!
I hate math, but this class was honestly great. She's a great professor and truly cares how her students are doing. She makes the classroom atmosphere very comfortable and is super outgoing. Learning the material is super easy because of the way she teaches. Great professor. 
literally i only went to class for the tests. she treats everyone like they're in middle school and uses the book heavily. easiest class I've ever taken, so regardless of the prof you'll be fine. she drops your 4 lowest quiz grades and the final grade takes the place of your lowest test. nice lady.
She offer's a lot of extra credit, but she does collect homework randomly and gives out pop quizzes. The test are pretty straight forward, but make sure you pay attention to her lecture because she moves fast! 
Prof Fackler has been my best math teacher at Grand Valley. She is very helpful especially if you go to office hours!   I would have not done good in this class if it wasn't for going to her office. Drops 2-3 lowest quizzes and replaces lowest test grade w your exam grade if you do better on the final. Very nice lady, highly recommend. 
I thought Professor Fackler was a very nice lady, but a horrendous teacher. I never missed class and I studied hard with even a tutor and didn't do well. Tests are extremely hard and she's a VERY hard grader. Wouldn't recommend her as a professor if you want strong grades.
I found to her be a very good mathematics teacher. I am weak in mathematics and she made it easy to understand. Gives bonus points on exams and a decent amount of extra credit. She's a strict grader though. If she asks for the equation remember to include f(x)= cause she's a stickler for that. She gives 12 quizzes and drops 2. Most are group based.
Not the worst professor ever, but not necessarily the greatest. Personality-wise, she's sweet and tries her best to connect to students. Her lectures are thorough and explained well. However, she's a VERY strict grader. She'll randomly hand out quizzes or collect homework, so try not to miss class. Take good notes and seek help when needed.
I hate math, so I took the foremost entry level class to the subject. Professor Fackler was very kind the first week of class. Slowly I started to notice that she was very rude and pretty much called all of us stupid without actually saying the words. Very disrespectful. Don't miss class. Always do your homework, never ask questions.
Prof Fackler is a very nice person and loves to teach math. She expects some level of mathematic skills before taking her class but I thought she was a great teacher. She's very nice and understanding and willing to spend her office time helping students. She gets to know everyone and wants them to do well. I loved her class! Do the homework though
She is an alright prof, but she can be very sassy to the students she does't like. Make sure to take good notes because she makes you feel stupid when you ask questions
Great professor.  I highly recommend her for math 110.  I was terrible at math in high school and she completely changed that for me.
Extremely easy class, makes things ridiculously easy. Just do the homework and you should be fine. Easy tests and quizzes. Only negative is that she can be condescending to students who ask questions when it's obvious they didn't pay attention to the original lecture.
Eh, not the best teacher in my opinion. I don't recommend her. She doesn't treat you with much respect and is not very good at answering questions. She also collects homework sometimes for a quiz grade. So you better not have any questions on that and get everything right!.....bad method","Not the worst professor ever, but not necessarily the greatest.

166,"Professor Mays is a great mathematics professor to understand, her lectures are great and she offers a lot of help to any struggling students. Mays herself is very kind and caring. I highly suggest her for any mathematics class at GVSU.
Prof Mays was one of the best profs I've ever had. Her classes can get boring, she cracks jokes and keeps it interesting. At the end of each class there's a ""quiz"", but you do it with your table and only turn in one. Her tests are easy and she tells you exactly what to study. There is homework after each class and she does collects it. TAKE HER!!
Professor Mays made math very easy to understand, especially for someone that struggles! At the end of every class almost she gives ""quizzes"", but you can work on them with a group of people which helps your grade a lot. She is VERY specific about what will be on exams, including the final, which was SUPER helpful!! Highly recommend!
Professor Mays is an ok teacher, nothing too special but nothing too awful. Her lectures are super boring - but it's math so you can't really blame her for that. She is straight-forward and honest about what's going to be on the exam. She has an in class assignment at the end of the majority of classes, which makes attendance mandatory.
She is a GREAT professor, highly recommend to take her class. She explained the information really well and answers your questions. She gives out worksheets after every lecture to practice and then your table group has to turn one in for a grade. She cracks a couple of jokes once in a while so she kept us entertained. Highly recommend!!
She was a really good professor, and always took time to work through problems if a student had a question. I would 100% recommend her to anyone. She did assign quite a bit of homework, but it was always relatively easy, and always easy participation points.
She was a great teacher and went at a good pace. Her quizzes were basically group worksheets and she always gave you more than she counted, taking your highest scores.
Such a good professor. She explained things very well in class and was always willing to explain more if people were confused. The homework is all out of the book and nothing online which is nice. Homework could take some time but she usually took some problems out of the assignments.
Jane seemed nice and she was available to help in class but her style of teaching included really understanding the material beforehand. I am not good at math so this was a very difficult class for me so if you're not very good at math and need a little more explanation I would not recommend taking her class, if you understand math, you'll be fine
She is a great professor who makes it easy to succeed in a difficult subject. She shows you different ways to do things including how to do almost everything on your calculator and gives formulas on tests.
Best professor ever. Helps you whenever, and really cares for you!
Mays is very quirky but its obvious she cares about her students and understands that not everyone is a math whiz. As long as you do the homework you should be set for the test. Attendance is judged based on group ""quizzes"" or worksheets done in class and she only counts the 1st 12. BUT, lecture is important to pass the class.
This class included a great deal of homework problems each week, that was very lightly explained in class. For the easiest math course available the professor needs to understand the students in her class are usually struggling in math and they need a more motivated professor to teach than normal. Which this professor was not. Homework and testing.
Wonderful person and teacher! Would definitely take her class again. She truly cares about your success and is very fair!
I loved Professor Mays for math 110. She really made the material as simplified and easy as possible to follow. She made sure that we could use our calculator and told us to solve the problems with it versus wasting time writing everything out. I would recommend her for any math class and she can be quite funny too. Easy A if you show up.
I am bad at math, and while I do believe I was at fault for my grade, this professor had an odd way of going about the content. She was lenient in giving homework points and quiz points, but was a very tough grader on tests. Most of the tests had problem that were not similar to homework problems which also bugged me. Average, but could be better.
At first impression I didn't think I was going to like Professor Mays. But lemme tell you. She is a VERY good teacher and cares about how you are doing. She goes over EXACTLY what is going to be on exams and quizzes are in groups. I would recommend her to anybody that struggles in math.
Professor Mays is AMAZING! Please take her! She cares so much for everyone and wants you to succeed. I was not a strong math-minded person coming into the class, but I left the class very confident! She explains what you need to know extensively and always is available to help. I would take her again in a heart beat.
Very nice. Test are pretty easy. Honestly one of the most relaxed professors I've had.
Wonderful professor! She helped me, and many of others, quite a lot.","Professor Mays made math very easy to understand, especially for someone that struggles!

168,"Good guy, lots of experience.  Sometimes drowns out innovative or critical material with personal stories that may or may not be politically correct, but very sharp and always willing to accommodate.
Long story short,  AVOID this professor at all costs. Lectures consists of him telling unrelated stories from the 70's and if you're lucky, very brief and vague explanations of class material. Forgets the answers to his questions sometimes. Somehow, I go a good grade thanks to his grading system but I learned NOTHING. 
I would never take this professor unless you absolutely have to. Lectures for 5 minutes, tells stories the rest of the time, and then when its time for the test he expects you to know every little detail and do a 2 hour test in 50 minutes.
He spend most of the class telling stories barely related the the course description. It felt like he did not prepare for any classes. He was very disorganized and bad at using Blackboard.
Very flexible about assignment due dates. Grading scale is generous. Had to do a lot of guessing on assignments and the midterm exam since they were extremely loosely based on the lectures. Very unclear when answering questions and assigning homework. Expect to do a lot of your own thinking. Deadlines were never stuck to.
His class lectures were horribly boring, and he spent most of the time telling stories which were not relevant. I emailed the professor three times throughout the semester with questions and never received a response. His experience is 30+ years old. I've since completely changed my schedule to make sure I'll never take a class with him again.
Very nice guy. His opinions are out there sometimes, but he's funny and he's nice. I wish we'd read more material relevant to Liberal Studies instead of just material relevant to his beliefs, but oh well. He cares a lot about his students.
This guy is ridiculous. We are supposed to be learning how to apply our knowledge in the field of Computer Science and he's blabbing on about telephones. Completely useless professor that should have retired years ago. He often laughs at his 'non-jokes' and doesn't go anywhere with his lecture. I've already contacted the suicide hotline.
Prof Jorgensen is a great professor.  I have taken him before and he is a fair grader, very clear, and adds humor to the class.  I have another graduate course with him in the Fall and I am looking forward to it.
Well, I'm really not sure why he teaches lib or what the point of that course is...but I still got an A. Really nice guy, and super easy class.
absolutely terrible prof. i dropped this gen ed class because he was so bad. he had no idea what he was teaching or anything about the program we were learning so advanced students in the class were actually teaching. you can't pay attention during lectures because all you can hear is your brain melting out of your ears. do not take this prof.
this class was a joke....very boreing and very easy.  I dont really know what he was talking about half the time but you do learn about his indian friends on the reservation...?  this class is the easiest for lib100 by far!
very boring class, but super cute old man...he reminds me of santa! i still don't know what a liberal education is, but an extremely easy class, aside from the fact that there is a TON of reading. one test. your best bet for lib 100.
so i dont think he even knows what hes teaching--and youll learn alot about the indian res. in south dakota. hes a nice guy, very friendly...but you will be itching to get out of class...and dont expect to really know what a liberal education is.  no tests or anything- but theres a ton of reading.  for lib, hes your best bet
a great grading scale, pretty much impossible to fail in this class unless you do not do your weekly reflection on the boring material. he was a wierd guy, but very nice and compassionate. you never have to stay the whole class period. when you are finished having a discussion about the dry material, you can go. its very easy but boring
Awesome prof, brings a lot of his own experience into the material. Has a good sense of humor, laughs at his own jokes a lot which is funny. Grading system is different but works, keep up with reading and you're set. Tests weren't hard as long as you took something from the class.
If you want to expand your horizons, then take a course from Jorgensen.  He knows how to apply the abstract in a very practical fashion.  He also has a good sense of humor.
The previous person must be totally lost.  Ferguson teaches 463 - not Jorgensen.
Since we didn't see him what-so-ever during this class...he was great.
Very unclear assignments and grade criteria. Good on the first half of the semester but learned nothing on the second half of the semester.","Long story short,  AVOID this professor at all costs.

169,"This class is 4 modules, each with 3-4 discussion questions that need to be at least 2 paragraphs each. It requires a lot of reading and critical thinking, but you have a few weeks to complete each module. He is a pretty easy grader. DO NOT wait until the last minute to do the assignment, because they are very time consuming. Great prof though.
Not only is he one of the best professors you will ever have, he is one of the best people you will ever meet. He is funny, insanely intelligent, and has so much life experience that he is willing to share. You will not regret taking his classes, in fact, youll regret it if you dont. He cares about his students and WANTS you to succeed!
One of the best professors I have ever had at Gv so far! the class is very easy to follow I took him online and only had 4 assignments no quizzes or test, and even though history is boring sometimes he made the class very interesting with the way he teaches, I would take him for any subject if I could!
Genuinely one of the most amazing people you will ever meet. His knowledge is so vast and his life experiences are incredible. He cares for his students and the subjects he teaches. His class may not be an easy A, but it is so insanely worth it. Take his class. Youll be so glad you did.
Professor Buckridge is an amazing professor. I have absolutely no bad words to say about him or his teaching style. I would take this class again honestly, especially since I missed out on half of a semester with him due to Covid-19.
Professor Buckridge was my favorite professor that Ive had. His lectures were engaging, he was funny, and I learned so much. You have to work for your grade, but an A is obtainable.
Brilliant guy. Knows African history inside and out, gives intriguing lectures, and grades very mercifully. If you show up to class and pay attention, his honors class was a breeze.
I loved having Professor Buckridge for AAA200. You certainly have to actually attend all classes, but they're all interesting and he is hilarious. As long as you take good notes its easy to pass all the quizes and exams. Few things go in the grade book, but its simple quizes, one big paper, and a midterm and final. Would definitely recommend!
Great Prof. He's one of the most interesting people I've met and tells great life stories. As long as you show up to class and take decent notes, it'll be cake. There's 2 quizzes, 2 exams, and a final paper which are all quite easy if you ask me. You won't regret taking Prof Buckridge.
Professor Buckridge is such a great professor. By far one of the most interesting people I've met which made going to class easy. He's very understanding to students who show up to class and listen, but gets annoyed with those who don't. The two tests and two quizzes are easy as long as you take good notes, he'll tell you what you should know.
To start off, Professor Buckridge is so attractive so it may be a little hard to focus. Personally, I learned so much from his class. One of my favorite class I took at GV. He is very knowledgeable. You must take good notes if you want to pass. All test/surprise quizzes are based on your notes. You will not need the textbook so don't purchase it.
Professor Buckridge is an amazing professor, and I would recommend him to anyone. It is hard to get an A in the class, but easy to get an A-. 2 tests each semester are worth 2/3 of your grade, and their is a lot of writing required for the class. Discussions however made the class all worth it. The prof is the most interesting person I have met.
Took him for understand Africa. The course was not difficult, a very easy A.
Professor Buckridge is a great prof, very knowledgeab and a well rounded, interesting individual. HOWEVER,He gives no slide shows for lectures so you must write notes by what he is saying. He will write key terms on the board but you have to write down all he says and half the time I can't keep up. Nice professor but not a fan of teaching style.
Mr. Buckridge is a great teacher who is very passionate about what he teaches. Tips for his class: 1. DO NOT hand write your notes, he talks a lot and fast.  2. participate in class, he does grade you based on participation  3. create a short & simple study guide before each quiz and you'll get an easy A 4. he will tell you need the book, you don't
Dr. Buckridge is easily my favorite professor so far, and one of the most interesting people I've ever met. I will probably go out of my way to take another of his classes in the future. Definitely go to his office hours for your paper and start writing it early, that'll ensure that you get a good grade and a paper you're proud of. Easy grader.
Professor Buckridge is an amazing teacher and it's obvious he really cares about his students. He is well-traveled and is incredibly successful. The best part about his class is the slides and stories he tells about his travels at the end of the semester. It was a privilege to be taught by him.
All he ever did was lecture, and he talks so fast that you're hand hurts within minutes from trying to keep up in notes. There are no outlines, and he skips around a lot depending on his mood. He was very pompous. There is a huge research paper that he gives only vague guidelines on. On the other hand, he gives good study guides for exams.
Professor Buckridge is by far the best professor that i've had at grand valley. His lectures were extremely interesting. He's an amazing professor. His passion for history really shows. If you attend lectures and really listen, the class is super easy. 2 quizzes, 2 exams, 1 paper. not bad at all. take this professor. i promise he's worth it!!!
He just lectures without anything to guide you except occasionally he will use overheads or write on the board. There were two quizzes, two exams, and a paper. He gives you a study guide for the exams but not quizzes. You must come to class to past because almost everything is on the notes. Willing to work one on one especially with the paper.

170,"Pretty unorganized with syllabus, readings, and general daily lectures. We had a small class, so she definitely noticed if you didn't come or submit something on time. Tries to be helpful, but often made it more confusing. Lectures seemed to be catered to those who had more knowledge on the subject already. Very nice lady, but not a great teacher.
Without a doubt the worst class I have taken at GV. She changes the syllabus several of times and is never sure of what to do. An absolutely ridiculous grader. More than several of the students did not pass the class. If you are scheduled to take her, GET OUT NOW.
She is a great professor!! If you take the time to meet with her to discuss projects or other work, she will really do everything she can to help you. Very easy to talk to. A bit disorganized at times, but it really doesn't affect her teaching or the class really. She is very flexible and will change the syllabus to meet the needs of the class.
Very disorganized. Very frustrating. She changed my grade on blackboard multiple times after already giving me points for assignments. Asked for assignments back that she graded so that she could re-enter my grades. She gets off subject a lot. Surprisingly she is getting an award for teaching...God help us.
constantly changing what is mandatory for the assignments and what is good or bad for the assignment. On the same paper took off points for certain thing and later in paper wrote ""great"".
Dr. Underwood is really a great professor. She is a little disorganized at times, but will do anything to help you. The class isn't hard but time consuming. She will work with you and is flexible pushing back due dates.
She is so disorganized. Literally modified the syllabus 5-6 times throughout the year.
disorganized, kind of mean. Didn't seem to care about individual students, and didn't let students fill out evaluations at the end of class.
Knowledgable, but rather disorganized. Vague assignments that were graded very hard considering.
Gave us the option of doing a journal instead of an essay!  I loved it and it helped me get a better grade!
Horrible professor. a feminist who needs to be brought back into the real world. decided to hand out a group presentation due the day before our final exam.
One of the best classes I've ever taken.  She knows her stuff and helps guide discussion.  Outstanding, highly recommended.
One of the least biased teachers I have had. Encourages discussion rather than rote page-turning. EXCELLENT.
Great Class, she is an easy grader on papers if you follow guidelines.  She is unorganized, forgets what she tells the class, but is pretty reasonable.
Interesting teacher. There was a lot of reading and a lot of notes, but if you came to class and did the homework, it's a fairly simple class. Study guides were very helpful, if you use them to study, there is no reason not to get an A.
Knows her stuff,and is willing to get together outside of the classroom,for whatever reason,if just to talk.Her lectures were a little...confusing...she jumped around a lot.But i think i might take her again...maybe...
She knows her stuff and provided ample learning opportunities.  While she is a little tough, she makes you think.  Only take her if you are willing to open your mind to other ideas than the ones you already have.
She is a terrible professor. Doesn't respect others opinions. If your aren't a feminist, your in trouble. I believe in equal rights but I also believe that people have the right to make their own choices. She doesn't.
She's pretty damn unorganized.. but this IS NOT A HARD CLASS. All you do is write a journal, pay attention to readings (skimmable), raise your hand every once in a while, and be nice to her.. you'll do fine. Projects were a laugh.. one with a movie and one about your family background. Damn easy.
She doesn't take into consideration your point of view. In her mind, only she can be right in a class that is very much based on opinion. Thinking differently will get a markdown. She's also very unorganized, and adds it into a student's grade if he/she doesn't compensate for that.","Pretty unorganized with syllabus, readings, and general daily lectures. We had a small class, so she definitely noticed if you didn't come or submit something on time. Tries to be helpful, but often made it more confusing. Lectures seemed to be catered to those who had more knowledge on the subject already. Very nice lady, but not a great teacher."
171,"Corey honestly slays. At its core, the class is pretty boring but Corey makes it actually so interesting if you really take in what he's saying. He is pretty funny and likes to joke around. He also likes to juggle so if you want extra credit make sure you can juggle. Reading quiz before every class out of 1 point which is pretty odd but so easy.
This class was on the easier side of classes however every week you had 2 quizzes based on the readings for each week. 5 questions worth 1 point, not many points in the class. Two explications about two readings you sign up for and one final paper that's 6 pages. Very clear criteria and lectures are heavy and based on the readings. 
Every class period has a reading and quiz that go along with it. Not too difficult once you get the hang of it. Just focus in class and you will do well. He also never gives 100% on any written work so do not expect it. Nice guy and makes lecture interesting. I scheduled a third class with him because I enjoy them very much.
Professor Anton is highly passionate and tends to keep class interesting. The course structure is pretty repetitive, but the course load is manageable and the conversations in class were interesting. Definitely a qualified professor for the subject, I would highly recommend Anton. 
Prof Anton is fine. Nice guy and passionate about what he teaches That said class is repetitive, quiz due before every class, students explicate the reading. If you have to take this class, communication theory is only so exciting. Class curriculum feels so draining and it's the same every single time. Super hard to stay motivated and go to class.
I had professor Anton for COM371 as well. He is awesome. There is a reading before every class period followed by a 5 question quiz. This can get repetitive and the readings can be really long and boring. However, his lectures are so intellectually stimulating and he explains the readings really well. Love him!
Such a good lecturer. The material definitely requires more effort but he helps in any way he can. There's paper, two exams, and weekly quizzes on readings. Also have to lead two reding discussions but it isn't formal. He really does care about his students and how he can help them. The environment he created for the class was very comforting!!
Literally 60% o his students do not deserve to have him as their professor. He is the most caring prof on campus about students well being and being in the class as well as he it a literary genius and author of multiple books, I couldnt recommend someone more.
This class mostly consists of quizzes for every reading. The midterm and final together are 60% of your grade. Quizzes and exams are open book / open note, but if you're not doing the readings or paying attention in lectures, it will be hard.
Cares about students and what they get out of his classes. Best prof. I've had by far.
He is very passionate about everything he teaches. The class was only 100 points and he rarely ever gives 100% on any writing assignments. Every class period we had a reading and quiz but they were interesting and his lectures were fantastic when discussing them.
Anton is very great guy and makes you think outside of the box with his readings. You have a new reading passage every week along with a quiz before every lecture about the reading. This can get really get repetitive which can sometimes not keep you focused on the lectures. Anton is very genuine and he wants to help you succeed!
Anton is a nice guy and you can tell he loves teaching, but the class itself is very repetitive and it made me dread going to any lectures. Assignments are easy but you have to take a quiz before every single class period. I would still recommend, maybe his teaching style is different in real-life lectures vs Zoom lectures.
Even though this was a COVID-19 semester, Anton did such a great job trying to make it somewhat normal! He is easily approachable and wants to help you succeed in his class. He knows that this is a hard class and you have to put in the work but he will help you with whatever often. Overall, really great professor and a really interesting class.
He's definetly a nice guy, but he is very specific about what he wants. All his quizzes and tests are ones he makes himself, and he asks very tricky, co fusing or philisophical questions which are very hard to get right. He knows alot about communication, but if you cant keep up with his overloading of info, it's going to be a rough time.
He really gets into his lectures and cares about teaching. Hes really funny and keeps your attention. The class wasnt that fun bc of all of the readings and quizzes but if you do the work you will be prepared and get an A
Corey Anton is a great professor. Easy A. Midterm and Finals you read you all good. Very clear. Get out of class early. Take home portions for Midterms and finals really easy basically  the class is you read and explain what you think the author is trying to say in the reading in short paragraphs. I would take this class over again.
Dr. Anton really cares for his students, but only if you put the effort in. He makes a 3 hour class actually fun and is able to relate the course work to our daily lives. He also loves to rant about societies problems, especially millennials, which is really funny
Prof. Anton was one of the best and most genuine professors I've had at Grand Valley. He is so enthusiastic and cares deeply about the discussion and understanding of the curriculum. His class was and the material that he had us read was challenging but though provoking. All but one of the pieces you read are posted online on BB.
Corey is such a good guy. Honestly, he really cares about his students and he is very intelligent. I learned so much from him and the way I think is completely different after this class. Incredible prof. You have to read a lot in his class. It is not books, but readings online. Tests are 5 multiple choice, one short answer, and three essay.","Corey is such a good guy.

174,"Prof. Zeman is tricky to rate. She doesn't deserve a 3 because she's actually pretty good at explaining things. However she doesn't deserve a 5 because she's just using slides to explain things. A handout packet (like some profs.) would be handy in a class like BIO120. Its a harder class, but she does a good job at teaching. 
I found professor Zeman to be a bit intimidating at first, but after sitting down with her I realized she really cares about her students. Professor Zeman is a tough grader; however, she offers great feedback on how to improve future assignments. 
Zeman cares if her students are understanding the material or not. Lectures are not very interesting as she reads off slides but she makes sure everyone understood the concepts. There are in class activities almost every week and she gives a code so you have to attend the lecture. Exams and final was online and honestly not that hard. 
Professor Zeman is a tough grader and tests can be a little tricky, but is very clear on what you should expect from her class. Pay close attention to slide shows and lectures, do the readings, and BE PRESENT for in class activities! Be ready to put in some work outside of class in order to succeed. Love her, definitely recommend her to anyone!
She was amazing!! Tough grader but you really learn the material!! She is so sweet too!!
Professor Zeman is a tough grader, but she provides great feedback on all assignments. Professor Zeman was extremely caring.
Professor Zeman was a great instructor for this course. Every test and quiz was online, along with the homework. She gives great feedback on activities and assignments and is very helpful. The content is challenging, but nothing terrible. The only negative to her class is that every lecture is a powerpoint.
She was a very good professor, however this entire course could have been online. The presentations were given and all the tests were online, the only reason to go to class were the in class activities. Would recommend this class if you are good at teaching yourself.
Lectures not engaging, often she over confused content that was 100x easier to understand from a tutor. Exams are online but so much harder than what we learnt in lecture. Often most the class failed on the same areas in the exam due to what we were taught. Not flexible, if you forget to enter a code you lose all the points from the work you did!
Is very hard on due dates 
Professor Zeman is incredibly nice, it's just hard to learn much when everything (homework, ebook, exams, final) is online. You'd think that'd make her class easier, but she goes through material in lecture very fast and nobody really asks any questions. I'm not a bio major so I struggled, but a lot of people did great I'm sure.
Professor Zeman is so understanding. She is always ready to help when needed. I would take any class she teaches again!
I just had prof zeman. Im pretty sure she recently changed the dynamic of bio 120 but all the tests and homework assignments are online. Lectures all hour but her lectures are amazing and you can tell she LOVES what she is teaching. She encourages questions and wants her students to do well. Due dates are final so read the syllabus!!
Just read through slides while you take notes. Test were hard, assignments were easy and quick. No late credit. Responds to emails quick and easily assessable 
Literally horrible. Condescending and does not help, just grades tough and will not let you leave unless you do everything at an A level. Do not take.
Tough grader, ask questions about assignments in person, they were unclear at times. Learned a lot about environmental ethics, provided lots of helpful answers, good feedback for the writing as it was an SWS class. Participation and attendance make a good chunk of the final grade. READ her syllabus!
Professor Zeman comes off as a welcoming professor, and that she wants you to do well. However, many are in this class just for a gen ed and she grades it as if we should know as much as she does (or even more)! You can complete an assignment well, and still fail it if it doesn't satisfy her. I do not recommend. 
She just reads through a powerpoint the entire lecture while you take some notes here and there. Was not engaging whatsoever. She makes the course way more difficult than it should be. Also, the exams are rather hard and often go over things that were not really emphasized in class. Wasnt terrible, but there are way better professors out there
She doesn't allow late submissions, the instructions for the lab were sometimes a little unclear and she played favorites, but if you do the pre-labs well, you should be fine.
This class was really hard for an intro class. She lectures very heavily. She was very easy to access for office hours. Attendance was mandatory and you miss the in class questions if you do not come to class.",Zeman cares if her students are understanding the material or not.

175,"Great professor. Knows how to derive pretty much every equation used and he shows you in class so you really understand what is going on.  He is very helpful outside of the classroom a really great guy.  If you get him in the fall you will get a surprise on halloween. Projectslabs  are awesome. Take this guy.
Great professor, goes over all topics thoroughly and is always in his office if you need extra help
Professor Aboufadel does a great job going in-depth on all topics covered. He gives time every class to check the ungraded homework from the previous class, and will walk the class through a few problems before starting his next lecture, which is basically just a series of new problems to walk you through.
gets upset real easy,  sometimes avoids answering questions, not sure whether he knows what he is teaching.
Basic Calc 1 class. Some of this teaching methods are a little childish, but he does know what he is talking about. The homework in class is not mandatory, but you will have a hard time keeping up in class if you do not do it. The projects for this class are very minimal as well.
He's Grand Valleys Math Board of Directors so he is really strict and by the books. I was doing alright until the final exam, which was a bunch of things he crammed into the end. A lot of group work. Don't recommend.
Good teacher with a weird sense of humor.  Very clear; sometimes he goes too fast, but just ask questions and he'll slow down and re-explain.  MUST go to class because he collects ""homework tickets"" and gives small quizzes virtually every day.  They aren't very many points, but they add up very quickly.
Great teacher. even if you're not very good at math, he's a good teacher to take this class with. He explains things better than any other math teacher I've ever had, and is always willing to give you extra help. do the homework even though it's not required and go to class and you should do fine
He's a really nice person, and is really smart, but his class was really difficult for me. There was a fair amount of homework and a quiz every week, just make sure you do the homework! The quiz points add up fast, so start off right. His final exam was impossible though.
The class wasn't bad if you actually put the work into it. The proof portfolio turns out to be pretty easy if you start it right away and turn in your drafts. You do have to go to class though because the book does not explain things well and he does a pretty good job and gives lots of examples.
Dr. A is a great teacher. He explains material thoroughly and cares about the students doing well. You have to come to class because the book is not very helpful.
I was really looking forward to this class, but came out feeling a little cheated. He uses Maple a lot - didn't help me one bit! I went to his office a lot for help, and felt like he thought I was somewhat unintelligent. Although I felt he explained things well in class, his tests always seemed really hard. Be prepared to work for your grade.
very large emphasis on computer use.  exams include using ""MAPLE"".  uses many examples, but simplest of examples only.  does well to help those who don't have a clue, but if you understand mostly and ask for clarification, he doesn't answer.  good if you don't have a clue, but other than that, it's mostly ""look what MAPLE can do"".
not very helpful, condecending.
Took a special topics course on wavelets, thought it would be interesting, turned out to be awful... :(
Excellent professor, sometimes kinda weird in explaining things if you ask a question in his office or in class. Gives a lot of points to work with. Isn't very leinient with mistakes and doesn't do extra credit. You could think you'd get an A, but you wont. Puts a lot of points in the last 2 weeks.
OMG! TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE! This class was supposed to be easy (or so I was told) but he makes it hard! If you have to take this class AVOID HIM! If you have him for anything else I guess he'd be ok.
Goofy!
One of GVSU's finest!","He's a really nice person, and is really smart, but his class was really difficult for me. There was a fair amount of homework and a quiz every week, just make sure you do the homework! The quiz points add up fast, so start off right. His final exam was impossible though."
176,"Absolute worst prof I've had. Attending lectures and feeling good about the material, isn't enough. Tests are too specific and have odd wording. She has the weirdest grading scale ever so you never know your grade which is probably awful because of the way her tests are. I dropped having a F - retook it with another prof and easily got an A.
This is the most frustrating class I've ever taken. I've attended every class and take notes but she puts problems on the tests and homework that she's never showed us how to do. Most of her quizzes and homework are completely fill in the blank and she looks for very specific answers and has vague wording so you don't know what she's looking for.
Worst professor I have ever had. I am very surprised she is still able to teach at GVSU. She was very disrespectful to me when I emailed her with questions about my quiz. She never answers questions about homework. She complains that people don't pass her quizzes literally saying it was disturbing in a blackboard announcement. 
I don't have one good thing to say about Prof. Matt. She ruined genetics for me as it was one of my favorite topics until I met her. Her homework and quizzes are nearly impossible to answer as she is very specific, will only accept her version, and won't ever give partial points. They are ALWAYS over things we never discussed. 
The worst professor I have ever had. Exams were extremely difficult and covered things we did not learn. I loved and understood genetics but still struggled in her class. When asking what I could do differently I was told I could start by learning the English language. Never went over examples so we never knew where we were going wrong! Avoid!!!
Don't take this class, she will get you in the position to get a grade W, she has some set of protocols she wants all the answers as per her requirements. Not recommended.
Worst professor I've ever had in my life. She was condescending and rude in emails. Exams and quizzes were mostly fill in the blank and she wanted VERY specific answers. The questions on the exams were things she never taught and couldn't be found in the book. AVOID HER.
Her exams and quizzes are open book, open note, open internet. She is very accessible and flexible outside of class and is more than willing to help. She drops your lowest grade at the end of the semester. Exams are just tricky due to specific wording. Put in moderate effort and you will pass no problem.
Professor Matthews is unwilling to help students when asking questions. Multiple times throughout the semester she told me she couldn't answer my question because it would not be fair to the class. She is very condescending in emails and expects very specific answers on homework and quizzes. She also takes points off for minor things.
AVOID. The lectures were not interesting, and you can barely take notes. On tests and quizzes expect to see a lot of material you've never learned. Also, she'll accuse your whole class of cheating and take it to the board. She is also very condescending when you are trying to get help from her. DO NOT TAKE HER.
This is by far the worst professor I have ever had in any level of schooling. She is condescending, rude, and her teaching style is out of date. Her exams and assignments are EXTREMELY difficult and often have topics never discussed in class. In all honesty, it is a shame GVSU still has her employed as it seems many of her reviews echo my own.
Avoid!! She accuses a lot of people of cheating and makes her exams next to impossible even though they're open notes. The information she provides in lecture doesn't match the exams/homework/quizzes very well and the exam questions are confusing. Attend lecture because she says important info that aren't in her PowerPoint lecture.
Professor Matthews has been teaching genetics for 30+ years and with that said is doesn't help the teaching what so ever. This was an online class, but she just read off the slides and did a couple of equations on a white board. Grade consists of 3 exams and quizzes a couple assignments. Quizzes are all fill in the blank and worded terribly.
do NOT take this teacher under any circumstance. Had her for an online class (originally was in person but she switched it). The quizzes/exams DO NOT match her lecture notes. She expects you to only focus on her class and none others. She teaches you HER way or no way at all. She accused my whole class of cheating and submitted some to the board.
For someone who knows how to study and use the textbook, never have I struggled so much due to her confusing wording on quizzes and tests. She expects her students to understand medical wording because she is in the medical field which is unfair. Shes aware that the majority of the class is almost failing or is and doesnt seem to care :/.
Her quizzes were nothing from the book or what we learned, and would not help during office hours. Grades were only from weekly quizzes, final and midterm, and 4 assignments from the semester. Ended up retaking the course with Nikitin in the summer and ended with a 96% compared to Matthews 78% I had at the WD date from just a change in professors.
One of the worst professors I've ever had. Would not recommend taking her because she failed to accommodate student's needs, was degrading, judgmental, and unprofessional in her emails. Overall, she showed poor teaching skills and it was clear she lost her passion to teach and make learning engaging.
Grading is absolutely brutal. You can study so much and know exactly what you're doing and then still fail an assignment due to the wording of her questions and she will mark you down for the worst reasons. I got marked off because I wrote a genotype twice, due to dyslexia, and still included the other correct answers and still didn't receive cred
PMat is nice, but she makes this class extremely difficult for no reason. All the quizzes and exams are open note and I was still struggling. The questions are so specific and sometimes dont follow whats taught in her lectures. The homeworks are even super difficult and she grades them based off correctness instead of completion.
P Mat is a decent lady. Her teaching sucks. She accused the whole class of cheating, her quiz questions are incredibly unclear (meaning she asks stuff that she never discusses in lecture). She stated students grades would also be impacted due to ""inappropriate emails"" sent to her. Overall, she's extremely difficult for no reason.","One of the worst professors I've ever had.

177,"Five non-cumulative exams and one paper where you study an adolescent. The lectures alone are just him and his monotone voice talking the entire time, no slides or anything remotely useful, but you are required to take notes. Any info on the exams comes solely from the textbook.
Paszek is genuinely a good professor if you love lectures. Make sure you take extremely good notes and READ THE TEXTBOOK. You need to know terms and put those terms into context for tests. There is one big paper at the end of the term and an EC with it so do both, start early. Use Vital Source for the textbook to save $ and is helpful for the paper
The information in this class was really interesting and he was a really nice professor. I thought the lectures were interesting but he would only cover a very small amount of the material that we needed to know and he writes very little on the board so it was challenging for me to take good notes. Reading the book is necessary and lengthy!
I really enjoyed this class! There are exams every two weeks, which seems like a lot but each are over only two chapters. They are easy to study for, especially when you do the chapter readings. There were 5 papers throughout the semester but they didn't have a length requirement and were very straightforward. Highly recommend Prof. Paszek!
Do not take Paszek for PSY364 unless you can stand to sit through super boring lectures. He lectures out of the book and writes maybe 5 words on the board all of class so you have to be listening to what he says. Also the exams are pretty hard and does not even cover what he lectures. Also can be pretty rude.
He only grades on six things, five exams (non-cumulative) and one paper. The paper is easy you just have to study a child. The only bad part of his class was the informal notes. He doesn't do slides or anything he just writes on the board. Just write down everything he says and study your notes you should do good.
I didn't think I'd do well with Paszek but his class was actually really easy. He is monotone but everything that he says shows up on the tests so take good notes. You really can't miss a class if you want to do well because of how lecture heavy the class is. Overall, Paszek is a great guy and a solid choice for a prof!
I loved Professor Paszek, he's really funny and gives good lectures. He's monotone but he throws in jokes a lot, so it's not as bad as people make it out to seem. You need to read the book, 80% of the exams are based on lecture, 20% from the book (for a few exams I just did the book vocab and would get high B's). No final, 1 paper which is easy
Prof. Paszek is super funny and is SO nice if you go to his office hours! The tests are pretty hard and you absolutely HAVE to read out of the book or you will not pass the exams. He can be monotone, but he adds in humor at times.
Nice professor, but very monotone. Going to class is mainly a waste of time, but he would sometimes play a video and have questions about it on the exams. He doesn't do PowerPoints, so you need to pay attention if you want to take notes. I recommend focusing on your textbook if you want to pass.
READ THE TEXTBOOK. Professor Paszek is a good professor, but boring. I fell asleep most class days. I did well in the class because of the textbook, you won't pass unless you read the textbook.
Very funny, laid back prof! Exams every other week, but only covers 2 chapters of the book and no cumulative final. However, you need to read and fully understand the chapters to do well as only a small portion of the exam is covered through lecture. There's 5 essays in total and all very easy as long as you describe and applied them to your life.
Paszek has a great personality, but I wasn't a fan of the class in general. Lectures were kind of pointless; they gave you an idea of the major topics he wanted you to learn, but his exams are chocked full of topics he didn't even mention in-class. Your grade is almost entirely based on the exams, except for one paper. Exams were difficult.
Prof. Paszek is hilarious! The material is basic and little studying is needed to get a good grade. As long as you read the chapters and go over your notes before an exam, you'll do fine. He writes few things on the board, so take notes on what he says. Loved this class!
We have 7 non-cumulative exams, including the final being non-cumulative. We also had 5 papers due, which are an easy 10 points each. Each exam is over 2 chapters, so its not too hard to learn and study for. Exams are 40 questions all MC. I would definitely take him for PSY 364.
I took this class in the summer & there were 3 exams & a paper. It's a lot of reading but if u read the chapters & study them throughly you'll do good. Go to class too cause what he lectures in class tells you what to focus on in the reading. A lot of ppl seem to struggle with this class & it's probably cause they didn't read. Overall solid choice.
Dr Paszek tested primarily on information he lectured on so I would advise going to class. Not overly exciting, but Dr Paszek was straight forward and fair; I would take him again.
Easily the worst professor in the Psychology Department that I have seen. His lectures are less than worthless; he writes little to nothing on the board, does not ask the class questions, and rambles on for the 50 minutes of class. His tests are based 90% off of the textbook, and the test questions are tiny insignificant details from the textbook.
not a bad prof. really dont need to go to class but you need to read the textbook. gives 7 exams all over about 2 chapters maybe 3 each. includes 5 papers but they're more like summaries (very easy grader when it comes to them) at the end of the semester those equal out to an exam. kinda dry boring lectures, but he throws in a lot of dad jokes
Pretty boring class for the most part. Tests were really hard. He only taught like 40% of what was on the exam and you had to take a lot of time to read the book if you want to do well. Overall Don was a goofy guy and tried to make the class entertaining by sharing jokes really only he laughed at though. No final. Just exams and papers.","Paszek has a great personality, but I wasn't a fan of the class in general.

178,"Amazing guy, whole grade is based on 4 tests, just study and youll be fine .
Jim is such a great prof. Easiest class of my life, never used the textbook although he says you will. All of the notes are in a powerpoint on black board. His lectures can be pretty dull, but Jim really makes the class. I'd highly recommend him for BMS100.
I found the class to be really laid back, and the subjects we disscussed were very interesting. But there are only 4 exams, and attendence counts toward your grade. If you aren't a good test taker like me, I wouldn't recommend this course. The teacher is kind of funny and really chill, but I never felt like I could come to him with any questions.
YOU NEVER HAVE HOMEWORK! easy gen ed as long as you study for the tests; there are only 4.  you never use your book just make sure you go to class and take good notes.  he does attendance through one min papers which really give your grade a boost. i would def recommend taking prof ledrick
This prof is very friendly and easy to talk to. He is helpful with any questions you have and good at responding to emails. He knows his material very very well and makes the class fun. I had it at 9:00 am and enjoyed going. You don't use your book often and there are pop quiz type things called one min papers.
good professor.  The book is not needed as the exams are over the lectures.  The final grade is a combination of 4 exams and attendance, so go to class.  If you're looking to knock out a gen-ed I would suggest him.
He keeps class interesting for the most part. He makes the material really easy to understand. he keeps the class pretty light, with pretty much no homework other than studying for the exams. Sometimes exams had material that wasn't on the study guide, so be prepared for that. I would HIGHLY recommend this class, useful material and great prof!
This is a great course for non science majors. Extremely interesting lectures to people who are interested in health on a surface/lifestyle level. Reading is unnecessary -- don't spend money on the book. Print out notes and study guides from blackboard. Go to every class, take notes, and pay attention. Easy A.
Kind of a boring class, but the professor is awesome. Such a cool guy and makes the material fun to learn. Recommend this class.
Professor is great. The whole class is structured around 4 tests that make up your overall grade. I think this is a very poor way to structure a class, but if you are just looking for a class to fulfill the stupid gen ed requirements then this is probably a good choice.
If you have taken health classes in the past, this class is a nearly identical setup. Mr. Ledrick is knowledgeable and helpful. He keeps the lecture interesting by talking to the class and sharing real-life stories and examples. Go to class as much as possible. No quizzes. Slides. Use book to study for tests. Attendance is important.
Sweet guy. I found this class very interesting. His lectures were straightforward and he used a lot of personal stories to help the students understand the material. There are no assignments, only 4 exams. Best advice is to take lots of notes during lecture and study thoroughly with the book. Overall, I got an A-. Not too difficult.
Really enjoyed this class, he is a great professor. Make sure to go to class and take detailed notes on his slides because that is what is on the test. DO NOT buy the book, I never cracked it open. Tests were slightly harder than I expected them to be, but still reasonable.
Professor Ledrick was an extremely nice guy and I enjoyed his lectures, but his tests are harder than I thought they'd be.  The study guides aren't always exactly what's on the test.  There is never homework though.  Only points are the tests and 10 one minute papers he gives (which are his attendance points). Still take him for sure.
Nice guy. Easy class all you have to do is study for the tests. They aren't hard just its an easy class with easy material that you think that you can blow off. He curves grades at the end which is good. Seriously if you study for the tests you'll get an A
He was a good prof. but the course was still challenging. If I were to go back in time I would still take me. He is a nice guy. He knows his stuff.
He only takes ""attendance"" 10 times throughout the semester with a 5 min ""quiz."" His lectures were kindof boring to me because they were at 9am but he is a very nice guy and our only grades were our 4 50 question, multiple choice tests.
Its completely a lecture based class but he is a very good speaker He is able to keep you interested in what he is talking about Always take notes if you only go off of the slides he puts online you will miss A LOT of questions on the exams DO NOT spend the  $90 on the textbook He NEVER uses it Dont skip class what is said in class is on the exams
The class is in a big lecture hall, but he speaks very clearly and doesnt talk soft so hes easily heard from the very back row. He makes the class interesting and hes funny. You do have to pay attention to notes and listen to what he says because not everything on the tests are in his notes. The stuff is really interesting and I loved it!
This professor is nice, not an extremely hard professor but does NOT offer extra credit, and  grade based all on tests. Which is difficult. PAY ATTENTION to notes in class, recommend you print off his notes from blackboard and also  write down the side notes he not only writes but says.",Nice guy.

182,"Griggs does not take his job as a professor seriously. It's all just a joke to him, he does not seem to care that much for his students. That being said, this guy is completely HILARIOUS. I was never bored during class. His lectures could be followed but were never really clear. Tests were ridiculous too with enormous curves. I think he is retiring
I think he's retiring but I wish he wouldn't. Homework is minimal, quizzes are 5 questions and you can take them as many times as you want to get full credit. His tests can be kind of tricky but if you're in class and you study the quizzes you'll do just fine. Very knowledgeable and adds humor to his lectures to keep you interested. Great guy. 
If you do everything that he tells you to do on the first day you will be successful in his class.  His teaching style IS effective IF you are willing to put in some outside work. He is very clear on what he wants. Great guy who is always willing to help out his students. Will definitely take one of his classes again. 
Recently started teaching 322 and he has no idea what he is doing.  Knows his stuff, but doesn't convey the information well to the students.  You will end up doing well in the class, but you won't learn a thing and will struggle in 422.  
His teaching style is not effective. Half the exam question are material he does not cover and are very tricky! Many people dropped and many people failed. Its pretty easy to get a B with effort but an A is very hard!I do not recommend him. (He is very nice though)
Watch out for his tricky exams, practice the problems in the book and show up for class and you'll be fine. A fair warning though, Griggs is a fan of kilts...
I really enjoyed Griggs. His teaching style is effective and he is more than willing to help you out when you're stuck. He truly cares about you succeeding. Do the suggested problems - He takes nearly half of the exam questions from them. Overall a good professor - I would take him again.
I'm going to put this very simple, ineffective teacher. I am now taking the class over with another professor and it is amazing how much easier the class is to learn now.
Exams are a bit hard but I really enjoyed him and this class.
HARD. very confusing. Very nice guy but the class itself is a pain to get through. No structure. Does not teach the theory but tests heavily on it.
If you have never taken a finance class before or have minimal interest in finance I wouldn't recommend him.  He is a great guy but its just a hard class.  It feels there is no structure to his lectures and you get lost quickly.
Griggs is a really nice guy.  He does a good job in preparing you for the free response portion of exams, but he doesn't do a good job in teaching the theory behind topics, which makes the multiple choice questions hard. He does curve exams and lets you drop your lowest exam.
Tells you what you need to know, so lectures are important. But exams are hard escpecially the multiple choice with choices a-z... exams are basically your only grade so it can be a tough class
I'm old school, I took Professor Griggs in the mid-1990's.  Loved his class, loved him.  A fantastic professor.  Took my finance degree and went to a top ten law school.
Pretty hard. Changes his demeanor from easy going Joe on normal days to prime Tyson, all is business, mr. Serious on exam day. Do yourself a favor and run this guy,
I had him for FIN 320. Great guy, makes you laugh, and teaches well. However, tests are pretty tricky, had to study a lot. Ended up with a B, but I wish he would give partial credit on tests.
The guy does a good job teaching to make you feel you understand the material, until you take his test. He changes his terminology and introduces problems that require a different computational process that he didn't teach. Everyone I have talked to says FIN320 is easy, none of them have Griggs. Dont put yourself through the misery!
He is a really nice guy but very very very tricky.  I am usually an A- B+ student and I cant get above a D+ on his tests its all about tricking his classes...
honestly the tests are not bad at all if you know the math its about 2/3 the test and some of the multiple choice is hard but not impossible. homework is a given 10% drops the lowest of three tests.
He is tough. Looks like Gary Busey and is just about as entertaining. Very funny and wants everyone to learn. However, the way he teaches is makes it harder than it needs to be.",His teaching style is not effective. Half the exam question are material he does not cover and are very tricky! Many people dropped and many people failed. Its pretty easy to get a B with effort but an A is very hard!I do not recommend him. (He is very nice though)
183,"I switched my major to marketing because Maria made the class that awesome. I wish I could have her teach all of my classes. You can tell she's really passionate about her students and she really wants everyone to learn. Take her!!
I am not a marketing major and only took this class for my HTM program. Maria made it so easy! Attend her classes and go to her for questions and this class will be a breeze! LOVE her!
I absolutely loved taking her class. By far my favorite professor at Grand Valley. She is super knowledgable and gives you great advice about things outside of the classroom like how to approach interviews and her past experiences. TAKE THIS CLASS! You will also be laughing a lot she is so funny.
Love Prof Landon and highly recommend her!  Her lectures are fun and engaging.  Take her for SWS, assignments are bullet form and she gives you the answers.  Tests are tough, read book definitions to help you on them.  Other than that the class is pretty easy.  She'll give you lots of advise to succeed in life, not just the classroom.
She's hilarious. Make sure to interact with her and smile!! She is the easiest prof for SWS classes because we didn't write any papers. There were six projects that were super easy to complete if you follow the directions. Tests weren't that bad either. I would take her again.
Professor Landon is AMAZING! Her passion for students and marketing is very evident. She truly cares about her students and wants them to do well. She teaches clearly and tells you exactly what is on the tests. The assignments through the semester are super easy as well. TAKE HER if you get the opportunity!!!
Landon is very passionate about marketing, the project is spoon fed to you all semester, but she is a tough grader, you will work for the grade, sadly I worked harder in this class than any of my Acc and MGT classes and still ended with a B. Test are hard because she does not prep you for them and a lot of T/F. But super nice to get to know!
A great professor! I have just taken her for MKT 350! Make sure you stay out of your phone and take notes. Be participative! She engages the class into her lectures. If you take good notes you won't need the book.  
Maria is a great professor! I do not like marketing nor am I majoring in it. She tries to get the class engaged (even though most students do not for some reason). I would take her class again! She is very helpful and will do whatever it takes to help you.
Maria is a very outgoing teacher and will definitely make the class worth while. Her assignments are pretty unclear, and require a good amount of time to complete. As long as you show up, take notes, and make study guides for the test, you should be fine. 
At first, she seemed really strict. But as you get more into the semester she is actually a great professor! I would highly recommend her. Just do the assignments throughout the semester exactly as she tells you and there should be no problem. She also tells you the types of questions that will be on each exam.
She has such an enthusiasm-I absolutely loved her! Just do the marketing assignment throughout the semester. It's fun and easy. Her lectures are engaging and interesting. Loved her!
She is always energetic and keeps the class involved. Stay off your phone and try to participate in the class and you will have no problems. I was not a marketing major before this class but after speaking with her I have added Marketing for my second major.
Landon is so much fun in class. If you have an open mind about her and the class, you will have a great semester. DON'T use your cell phone in class (look at syllabus). And ask questions as you have them, she is so willing to help. I'm not a marketing major, but this was by far my favorite class of the semester.
Such a fun lady! Make sure to participate and stay off your phone or you'll be in for a long semester..I'd highly recommend getting on her good side. The tests weren't bad if you studied. The semester long project wasn't bad either-I believe the same as the normal MKT 350 class. I would highly recommend Maria for this class!
One of my favorite professors so far! She was always energetic and had our class laughing all the time.  I am a marketing major and this was my first marketing class so this was a GREAT start to my marketing classes.  I would recommend her for sure!
She is an awesome teacher who is energetic and passionate about what she is teaching. She expects participation and if you do it will make class go more smoothly. Assignments take time but are fairly easy and clearly explained. Everything is straight forward and I highly recommend taking her especially for SWS since the writing was bullet points.
It depends on personality type if you will like this professor. My class is a bunch of introverts, and she expects all of us to be awake and bubbly like her at 9am, and criticizes us every class period for not talking. Also, it didn't matter how long I spend on assignments, the grade is always a B. Make sure to do well on tests if you want an A!
I didn't have an issue with this class. We created a marketing plan and that was pretty much the entire class work load. She also had to turn it in and then get a grade, and then make revisions. The funny thing was, you would turn it in, she'd give you a D, then go make ""revisions"" (print the same thing) and your grade is a B (with no changes)
Was hoping for a much better class but it wasn't bad. No HW, no quizzes, easy test and BIG group project. She is very nice and always happy.",Such a fun lady! Make sure to participate and stay off your phone or you'll be in for a long semester..I'd highly recommend getting on her good side. The tests weren't bad if you studied.

184,"Confusing, gave us his own definitions ( which you have to write exactly what he says on exams to get credit) and half the time is wrong with what everyone else the concept is. Also will not answer your questions and will interupt you when you are asking a question
NOPE. Do yourself a big ol' favorite and get out of his class while you can.  Even though he's relatively easy, dealing with him every week isn't worth it.  He is incredibly passive aggressive and argues with students if they don't agree with something or asks a question. Buying the book is also useless because he only teaches his opinion anyways.
This class with John Hodge is so unbearable. I honestly thing this is the worst class I have taken in my time at Grand Valley. I don't think I learned anything at all except for random ideas that popped into his head.
If you wish to learn the subject of  Management then do no take this course with Professor Hodge. It's a painful class to sit through and all he does is bash the book and the author. You will learn Professor Hodge's version of Management and nothing else.  However as long as you attend class and write down what he says you should get an easy A.
Professor Hodge was the most confusing I have ever had. He would go over the book just to tell us it was all wrong. If you don't write word for word what he lectured in class on the exams, he will mark it down. Has many sayings he repeats over and over again like ""Come on guys"", ""Do you hear what I'm saying""
The 331 6-9 never went the full time, all the grade comes down to is, three exams and one 12 page paper, wants to help students however can become very annoying with his repetitive statements and confusing lecturing.
Hodge is a very interesting man. He is kind of funny but his lectures are boring. He is very specific about what he wants for your test which is nice but when it came to my SWS paper it had to be exactly how he wanted it which was frustrating. If you don't care about actually learning, then take him.
This is my fifth year at GVSU and I am disappointed with John. If you want to learn management take someone else. John teaches it with his opinion and not what the book says. He grades harshly on the research paper. I visited his office hours, did what he told me to do, and still got a B- on the first attempt. You can redo paper for a second grade.
Prof. Hodge is difficult to explain.  If you are content with learning nothing about management, but would like a GPA boost,  I recommend him.  If you aren't one for sitting in class watching him recite his opinion on the textbook terms day after day after day, another professor might suit you better.  I took this class for the near-free A.
Not the most enjoyable can become annoying put he gets his point across and you do learn. His test are easy he tells you exactly what to write down( exactly what he says in class not what is in the book!) 
SERIOUSLY. DON'T TAKE HODGE. Or, take him, if you want to hear the same stupid stories, ""witticisms,"" and phrases LITERALLY EVERY CLASS. ""Please!"" x24. ""Am I making sense?"" x6. ""Are you hearing me man?"" x4. ""I'm serious!"" x12 You will hear these phrases on repeat until you are so sick of hearing the man talk that you knock yourself unconcious.
Take this review to heart. He is horrible in the sense that he will not teach you about management at all. He gives you every answer for the test so I guess its fairly easy, however, he is a wack-job. Very tough grader on the paper. STAY AWAY FROM HIM AS A PROF. He only teaches what he believes and nothing about management at all. Again, STAY. AWAY
Hodge is an interesting guy. He says ""i hope you hear me"" and ""i'm very serious"" a ton  and attendance is mandatory so he'll walk around with a sign in sheet. The exams aren't too bad and he'll tell you exactly what's on there as long as you go to class. The research paper is a bit tougher but he lets you re-do it. Just participate and you'll do Ok
Hodge is a good guy. Need to know a lot of specifics for the exams (all written). Go to class, say hi to him, talk every once and a while. TAKE NOTES. He tells you whats on the exams. Tough grader on the research paper (have a chance to re-do it). Don't take certain comments too personal. Overall he's entertaining in class, just expects a lot.
He is bad - But not THAT bad. Go to class, sit in the front and make sure he remembers your name. One 15-page research paper, three exams that are all essay. He can be annoying but if he can remember your name and your face, you'll do well.
Professor Hodge is great. Seems a little crazy at first but he is so knowledgable and loves helping students. Stresses student participation strongly. Overall good class.
He's actually good.  Class is entertaining and he's funny and knows his stuff.  He's quirky (like most professors), but other than that I don't get what all the fuss is about.
Hodge got in a lawsuit against GVSU...and they settled. Part of the settlement was that he could still teach. That's the only reason I believe he's still around, because he's an embarrassment to the educating profession. I've lost all faith in GVSU after having this man as a professor...he's an absolute disgrace.
Worst Prof in my 4 years at GV. Only way to get an A is to continually kiss up to him and stroke his ego.Tests don't really contribute to final grade, and are more determined on whatever he wants. Very frustrating class.I am shocked  and embarrassed that GV has allowed him to teach more than 1 semester let alone for over 20 years.
IGNORE OTHER POSTS - he's not bad.  Attend class, participate (nod your head), speak up, and you'll do well.  A lot of my fellow GVSU students are whining, but the material is there if you take ownership of your learning.  Hodge supplements the book material well, so you can come out with a good understanding if you put in the work!","Take this review to heart.

185,"It was tough to know what grade I had at any given point because nothing is on blackboard but otherwise his class was very easy and content light. 
Litterly the easiest class I have ever taken in my life. There are no tests or quizzes in class, they are all take home and after you submit them you can revise them to get the grade you want. He is a very caring, nice prof and you can even get credit for assignments by going to office hours. Such an easy class, definitely take him!!
I saw someone rated prof Golden back in October 2021 and gave him a 1. I want to say I took the same class that semester and he was terrific. I personally didn't like the class format (mostly discussion mixed with group activities), but prof himself was very helpful and caring. I learned a lot in that class. The class expectation is very clear.
John is a really nice guy, but the class is slightly unorganized. Don't really need to do much to pass the class, but the class was usually boring (mainly because the class is about the history of math).
Dr. Golden was one of my least favorite professors that I have had at Grand Valley. I did not learn a single thing in this course. He never posts grades throughout the semester and he is often unclear about his expectations. However, I will say that he did a good job in establishing a feel good student learning environment.
Professor Golden was one of the best professors I've ever had at GVSU. He answered every question I had and he was very reasonable about the work he assigned. There were no tests or exams just some questions that we had to answer on our own time that he graded and we were able to revise as many times as we needed to get the A. TAKE HIM if you can
Professor Golden is a very genuine guy. I learned a lot in this class due to the one-on-one teaching with younger students. However, the course work was a LOT in this class. Way too much homework in my opinion. The organization is also a bit hard to grasp because all of our assignments are in one google doc. He also doesn't put grades in BB at all.
While he's a nice guy his class is way too much work for the lack of instruction and clear guidelines. He uses one google doc instead of blackboard which is annoying because you have to constantly check that doc. No grade book so you don't know what you get until the class is done. Expect tons of busy work and too many hours spent on assignments.
This is a very easy class if you just show up and do the homework which isnt very much and isnt hard. Youre not graded on much and there arent any quizzes or tests. Hes a great guy and is passionate about what he teaches and has a lot of experience. Its a long class but he keeps it interesting most of the time.
Such a nice guy! He truly loves math and has so many tips and tricks to share. Very patient and willing to listen to students' advice and feedback with regard to the course itself. Highly recommend!
Professor Golden or otherwise called John, is a really good professor. I can tell he loves what he does and cares about it too. We had NO QUIZZES OR TESTS OR EXAMS. Instead we had math writings which are easy to acquire A's on. He is my favorite professor and I enjoyed taking his class. John is also an avid star wars fan which is awesome!
Dr Golden is fantastic, he is trying to alter the way we see math and the way we believe it should be taught: comprehension, deep understanding vs remember this and that and apply. He wants us to help our future students engage with the math. His class set up is unusual, but fun. Open your mind.
Loved this prof! Although he never used blackboard and you never knew your grade, as long as you came to class and shared work with your table group you were passing! He definitely knows what he is talking about and has a lot of experience. The lessons we did were fun and useful. I'd take prof Golden again!
If you are not a math major, RUN!!! I am an English Ed major and I spent the entire semester confused and irritated. His class is unorganized. There are no tests (which is nice), however, I never knew what my grade was. The class is easy, but if you want to get something from your tuition payments, don't take this class. Please, just don't do it.
He doesn't give tests, instead he does sbars. They are very unclear to how you are doing and he doesn't use blackboard. You won't know your grade until the end of the semester because he doesn't even know. Really no structure to the class and that alone makes it hard to figure out what is going on and why you are doing some of the things you do. 
Nice guy but extremely unclear. no class structure and absolutely useless when it comes to being helpful. cant stand this class or him as a professor
Very creative, kept class interesting
Prof. Golden was really helpful! Go to his office hours!!! There are 2 workshops assigned every other night, just stay up on those and you'll be okay. I liked building a strong network of fellow teachers in this class. He did a great job with that. I did not learn that much math, but it is Teaching HS Math so there wasn't too much math to learn.
Really nice guy, but did not like him as a teacher. Quite a bit of daily work required plus directions are almost never clear. He is really into letting you learn on your own so if you like that then this would be a good class, however I do not and because of that feel like I learned very little at all during this class
he is very flexible. 2-3 workshops a day, gets tedious but keep up on them","Loved this prof!

186,"Didnt love him at all
Hes a good teacher. His homework and readings were the death of me literally took SO much of my time. The tests are very difficult. You MUST go to the lecture to pass. Hes not a dumb professor so dont try and make excuses. Not very lenient at all he has clear expectations.
Matchett wasnt an awful prof, but he wasnt good. Chemistry has always come somewhat easy for me, but the way he taught it in lecture was confusing and made it difficult. He also has a temper and had yelled at my class numerous times through the semester and can be rude over email. If you can, I would switch profs if you get him.
Matchett obviously knows his material, but in class I found the way he explained it quite confusing- his office hours helped! The readings were confusing/not helpful. Being in pre-vet, I have to juggle other tough classes, but the amount of work homework he gave us was ridiculous. It did not let me accurately utilize time for those other classes.
Chemistry is super hard for me personally. Prof Matchett clearly cares about chemistry and his students. He emphasized how much he wanted to help you in any way possible. I took this course during remote learning and struggled but I dont believe it to be his fault, it was my own. He tries hard to make chemistry interesting for everyone.
Before every class there is a reading homework which would prepare you for lecture. Then you would have 2 homework assignments on webassign due on Wednesday. This class was super hard. My advice is to not use chegg. It might help for the homework but the homework isnt worth enough to out weigh the test. Ask him for help, he will go out of his way.
Solid prof, but a hard class. There was a few hw sets per week usually. Prof Matchett had good lectures. Hes always willing to answer questions and clear up any confusion. Going to his office hours really helped. He cares and wants ppl to succeed. His tests were hard, but not as bad as the final.
Very encouraging and passionate. Even though it was hard, he really wants his students to learn a lot and I do think it'll benefit be me a lot in the future. I studied lots, did homework all the time, focused, went to chem success center one day a week and met with mr. matchett another day of the week and I barely got a C. Great prof, hard class
Matchett is an awesome guy. I had him for lab, and his explanations at the beginning of the class were the reason I understood what was happening in my lecture. He always answers questions in a way you can understand. I wish that I would've had him in lecture.
His tests are tough but he teaches the material well, im taking him again next semester for chm 116.
I liked his class at first but It all went down hill when he was snarky to me because I used my phone in class to take a picture of the board when he asked us to. Since then I wanted to attend the class less and he was rude more and more and is extremely passive aggressive to me outside of class. If you don't live and breath chem he's not for you.
A lot of reading/ homework assignments but the class is overall amazing . His lectures make you pay attention and his voice is not monotone.
I absolutely love Professor Matchett. You can tell that he is extremely passionate about chemistry. He always tells us funny stories and uses amazing analogies. He gives good notes, but a lot of homework. But the homework really helps to further your understanding of everything. I did everything I could to get him for 116 and I did. Best choice!
I liked Matchett so much for 115 that I did everything I could to take 116. He gives very clear lectures and homework that makes sense. In 115 we had a few sets of homework due once a week but in 116 we had readings due every day before lecture in addition to the homework. At times, he can be condescending and rude.
He was a goof prof, he knows a LOT about chemistry and is willing to help. He can explain things in multiple ways. Only thing is that the hw given sometimes didnt match what we did in class, the chem success center helps though. Overall a good prof, just put in effort!
Taking Matchett for CHM 115 & 116 was the best choice I've made at GVSU. His lectures are interesting, easy to follow, & filled with helpful examples. His class notes are golden - my friends & I often wish we had Matchett-style notes for organic chemistry. He is funny, caring & an amazing prof. (P.S. lots of Webassign work but it helps you learn.)
Professor Matchett is MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR!! If the tests are hard, it is because the materials are hard, so you have to work for it. He likes linking the materials to real life (focus on ""why"" and ""how""). There will be readings written by him and homework. You may think it's a lot, but they definitely helped me with understanding. TAKE HIM!!!!
Professor Matchett is ONE OF THE BEST professor I have ever had and I MEAN IT. His lectures are very clear and he makes sure you understand the materials, not just memorize them. He writes down his notes so he is not flying through materials. You'll have reading assignments and homework. It may be a lot but it definitely helps. TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN!
I LOVED this professor. I wish I had him for 116 as well. He's very passionate about chemistry and it shows in each of his lectures. He relates content to real world examples which helps clarify topics. Homework directly related to class content and often would show up in tests. He's funny but also very straight to the point. Highly recommend!
Professor Matchett is an amazing professor. He gives clear explanations and is always willing to help you understand the material. The tests were very tough, but as long as you study and do the weekly readings you'll be fine. Be prepared to work hard for the grade you want. Would definitely recommend taking his class if you can.","Professor Matchett is an amazing professor. He gives clear explanations and is always willing to help you understand the material.

187,"Star is nice but her class is hard. She doesnt really lecture and class is solely based on other students presenting the information to the class. It is all memorization and there is no book or formal notes to reference after class. the whole class is out of 100 points and it is very difficult
Professor Swift was very knowledgeable about the law and was also very funny. However, she makes you work for your grade. There were several case readings and questions each week and your were only graded on 3 quizzes, 3 tests, and one presentation. It seemed to be taught more as a general law class than business related.
Professor Swift is an amazing professor. She is very caring in addition to being extremely knowledgeable when it comes to the law. She has a great sense of humor and makes the lectures very entertaining. Due to this being a hybrid course, there is a lot of reading assigned for outside of class, which you will be asked questions about.
Swift integrates technology into her classes more than most professors. So be open to learning the law and new tech. Brilliant and funny. I will take her again if I can get into her class.
Swift is one of the best profs I have had so far. The amount of knowledge I have learned in this class is incredible & is also very applicable to the real world. I took the class as a hybrid so we met once a week. Lots of cases to read which will be on pop quizzes, also likes to call on random people so be prepared to answer questions on cases.
I took Swift's hybrid class, and it was one of my favorites. She may seem intimidating at first, but Swift is an awesome professor who knows what she's teaching. Don't procrastinate the work until before class, and if you don't know the material, don't try to pretend you do. I learned so much from her that I'll be able to apply to my career.
She grades you on quizzes, a presentation, and exams. You have to keep up with the reading and you will do OK. At first, I just skimmed the reading and learned the hard way, from my quiz score, to read the stuff carefully. I am going to med school but I wish I took this class earlier. Everybody should know this stuff for their work life.
We arbitrated case in front of a real arbitrator.  Swift walks you through each step but she is not happy if you do not read and watch videos.  The workload is not crazy but if you have a bad team be ready to do a lot of work on your own.   Liked Swift. Totally applied class.
Hybrid class so we met once per week.  She uses a thing called Bluescape so you can see videos, notes, other stuff all on a virtual wall.  She is good about giving class very recent cases.  You have to do the work or it shows in your grade but the work is not too much.  Thing I learned is half the class time does not mean half the work.
Despite the difficulty of the BUS201 class, Star Swift is my absolute favorite professor. She's reasonable, helpful, and one of the funniest people I've met. Her lectures include examples from her personal experience, and they make understanding the material much easier.
Honestly, the class was whatever. I didn't do much of the work but passed perfectly fine. The tests were difficult but if you put forth the effort in studying before it, you'll actually do fine. The class used Bluescape, which was cool. I actually just love her as a person, she's hilarious and really relatable.
It was an honors law class.  It was also hybrid. My online classes were never this hard. Way up to date cases.  Lots of reading but I let myself get behind. I learned to arrange my time because you have to keep up. High school online was easy for me and I Googled the exams. I needed to study for Swift. But I did ok. Just not high school at all.
It is a hybrid so she expects you to read material from her websites before class.  A lot of students do nothing before class. But they think Swift is going to lecture on it in class. She doesn't.  So group work is tough. Plus everybody works so they claim they cannot meet  after class. I did most of the work for my group and learned a ton.
Uses Bluescape instead of Blackboard. So you need to learn new tech but not really youth.  It's a hybrid class so do NOY miss the one day per week it meets.  Reading you must do on your own will be on ex.m.
She is great. The grading scale is rough and you better start out strong from the start. I really enjoyed having her as a teacher but, I didn't get the grade I wanted. She is more like a boss then a teacher. Great person though. Highly recommend her.
I took the honors section and it was a ton of work, but I think that should be expected with an honors class. Super knowledgable lady and she's always there to answer any questions. Exams are tough, but again, in an honors course you should expect that. All in all she was super cool and I really liked her class!
Really good class. You do not have to buy a book. The work load is totally accessible. There are just a few assignments though, so not there is not a lot of room to mess up.
I took a hybrid class, and not once did I learn any information from her in class or through her lectures. She posts documents online, expects you to complete them before class, and then does not teach you the information. She's a horrible. Always has unclear directions and no guidelines for you. These other reviewers must have had a diff professor
Took hybrid as freshman and it was night class. Wish she had day class once per week. Now she does.  Good grade but did lots of reading. She makes up free text.  Read it.  If you get the chance take her class.  You will be ok if you read her stuff. We all laughed lots. Made me think about stuff I can use once I decide on major
Uses Bluescape. Also lightboard lectures for review of material. Funny. Honest. Hates to waste time - ours or hers.  Knows we all have jobs. Will take Swift for hybrid 432. Up to date reading  and video but no text. I learned a ton.","I took the honors section and it was a ton of work, but I think that should be expected with an honors class.

188,"This class was way to hard for a Gen Ed. I would not recommend taking it. I had to for my major and I might have to retake it.
He talks extremely fast in lectures so its hard to get all of the information. Also, I never understand his explanations. Exams are so hard because almost all of them are story problems. I usually get good grades in all classes and find it nearly impossible to do so in his class. Very difficult and stressful for a gen ed class. Dont recommend.
He is a very helpful professor if you email or meet with him about questions that you have you'll be fine. tests have examples that are in the book or similar to ones he says in lecture. PSY 101 is a tough class with any prof you just have to do the work.
He is a great professor, as long as you read the book and take good notes you will be just fine. Tests are easy and follows the outline to a tee. Great prof!!!
Hard class! Hes very smart, but his exams are more in depth that what he teaches in class.
REALLY NICE GUY BUT IF YOU WANT A GOOD GRADE DONT TAKE HIM FOR A GEN ED!!! SAVE YOURSELF AND CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PROF FOR PSY 101!!!!
If you want a good grade with this prof, pay attention and take notes during lecture. Although the tests are difficult, he has a different grading scale than others to get an A. When it comes down to it, work hard for the grade you want. He also doesn't put grades on BB so you don't know until the semester is over. Work hard on final!!
If you can get out of his class I would. The class is based off of 3 exams and thats it. The tests are very hard and the questions are not straight forward. There are no notes or handouts for this class everything is based on his lecture. Most of the information needs to be looked up online after class and that information isn't always accurate.
Your grade strictly depends on how you do on the exam. He provides no notes, no powerpoints. Only provides a five page outline and does not explain the concepts. The exams were very hard even if you some how got all the information down for the concepts. Do not take this gen ed from this professor.
Hes a great professor and is really good at explaining the material but the lectures were always long and in order to pass the exams you had to pay attention to everything. Your grade depends only on 3 exams and other mandatory activities. Theres never any homework just reading that is necessary to do well in the course.
He gives good lectures, if you pay attention and take notes during lecture you will do well since most of his test questions come from what he says in class. He makes it easy to either get time or talk with him or his teachers assistant if you ever need any help. Overall, a good professor.
Great professor
Super hard class. Don't think I've put enough time into studying and I've gotten a C on all the exams. Don't bother buying the book either. If you study a lot you should be fine though.
Don't burn your bridges.
Professor Henderson is very monotone during lectures and does not put any lectures on blackboard. He only gives an outline for topics that will be on the exams and the exams are all application based. Exams are very hard to study for unless you go see him personally or see one of his assistants.
After the first exam I thought for sure that I would fail, it was that hard. Everything was application based. I increasingly did better on each exam. At the end he either takes your grade in the class or just your final exam grade as your overall grade. So work really hard to get an A on the final, its not impossible.
He keeps class interesting by doing some little fun activities. However, taking notes is hard because he doesn't give a power point,  just and outline. A suggestion I have is to write down every example he gives and evaluate them with the outline.
Lectures are entertaining but the test are hard. Go to class he covers a lot in lectures. The outlines he post really help with the exams. You don't get homework only 3 exams and a final.
Prof Hendersen's exams are extremely tough, so be prepared to study. I know a lot of these reviews say not to take this prof, but he's a supper nice guy and knows what he's talking about. He truly cares about his students and wants to help. If you study A LOT you will be fine. But seriously study a lot! Or you WILL fail at least the first exam.
I honestly enjoyed Professor Hendersen's class.  There are 3 tests and those are basically your only grades, along with the final.  The tests are tough, especially the 1st one, but don't let that scare you away because you really do learn a lot in this class and if you study, read the textbook, and ALWAYS attend class, you'll do fine.","He keeps class interesting by doing some little fun activities.

189,"He actually knows a lot about the topic, if you are willing enough to listen to what he's saying it is actually very interesting. He can be confusing because he's old, but he's actually a decent professor if you listen and try to understand.
Actually miserable.  Guy rambles on about god knows what (no religion pun intended), and then expects you to write a paper or take short answer tests and elaborate on extremely vague concepts. Just about everyone in the class is clueless about his expectations. If you're looking for an easy elective and figure this is a good choice think again.
He likes to mumble
i liked the class. as long as you read all the material and keep up with the concepts you should be fine.  he can be boring at times when he gets wrapped up in something but for the most part its a good class.  sometimes he drifts away from the ideas of the book we're reading and then it gets confusing but otherwise its easy.
note: I was in the honors section. He was still horrible.  Lecture was a snooze, and a waste.  Just give an overview on religion and how they differ.  Not in touch with his audience.
Tests can be confusing so watch out.  But he's a nice guy and a decent prof.
The WORST handwriting ever. Where does the test material come from because it is very obscure.
not that hard of a class, little boring, but not bad
if you actually pay attention, this make sense. look at the big picture.
horrible, boring. lectures had nothing to do with the stuff on the tests
HORRIBLE!!!! The worst!  You teach yourself!!!!!!
Can't Teach. Class is so incredibly boring, it's impossible to do well!
I rarely have any idea what is going on; the TA's are much easier to understand
This guy can not teach, he is a horrible professor - which makes the class impos","Actually miserable.

193,"Sammy is a prime example of how it's better to be feared than to be loved. At the start of the semester, he clearly laid out his expectations and grade requirements (which were very high), but he was not unfair or unwilling to talk one on one. You were required to participate in class and read a chapter every week. Very hard, but I learned a lot. 
A nice guy, but a TERRIBLE professor. Assigns more assignments than I can count, and tests are EXTREMELY long. Grading criteria is hard to get used to and very specific, but not terrible. He expects almost memorization of the chapter, and his workload is unbelievably high. He does not 'lecture' on material, only answers questions. Do not take him. 
If you know how to read a textbook and study, you can pass Ishak's class. Assignments and papers are easy enough if you put the time in.   But here's a bit of advice: RUN FAR AND RUN FAST.   Do not take this professor. He is one of the most awful people I've ever met, let alone the worst professor. 
Professor is extremely arrogant and rude to all students.  Comes off very pretentious and talks down to students.  Also has made inappropriate statements during lectures.  All being said, if you stick it out and get all the assignments up and stay up on the material, you will learn a lot and the class will be rewarding.  
Taking his class right now. worst professor at GVSU so far. His assignments take 5 hours to complete but only worth 6 points. he is rude demanding arrogant and obnoxious. he will not listen to anything and if you ask a question you wont get a straight answer. avoid at all cost.
Very hard prof, this class was a monster however i stuck it out and found it to be very rewarding. you learn a lot! lots of reading and memorizing chapters for exams but once you figure it out its not so bad. The prof and his assignments were very demanding. Theres no b.s. in the class, and it was very challenging but im glad i took it
This professor is just amazing. Lots of people don't like this classe because it is exigent. But it is not superficial and you learn a lot of thing. I highly recommend this professor, but be prepared for this class!
In his class right now.... One of the worst professors I've ever had in my entire education experience. He is a mean old man and puts you on the spot. Makes everyone in the back row move to the very front row. Assignments are like getting a bullet in the foot... You've just been shot & are bleeding but unfortunately, still alive. DO NOT TAKE HIM.
Need to put 200% effort. At least 15-20 hrs in the weekend and 2-3 hours in the week.Very demanding and will keep challenging the entire semester. Be prepared in every class if you don't want to be embarrassed in the class.He helps immensely with the class matter but not the personal issues in dealing with the class. Buckle up for a roller coaster.
If you want an easy A, this is definitely not your class. If you're looking for a challenge, take his class. I walked away with an A from his class. I am so honored to have had such a ridiculously successful man as a professor. His assignments are deadly. But if you're willing to do the work, it will definitely be worth your time.
Absolutely terrible and blatantly favors international students.
I honestly believe that the comments that refer to Prof Ishak as the ""best teacher ever"" must be written by Ishak himself. He is arrogant,rude, demeaning, & many other things that an effective teacher is not. His expectations are inconsistent & unrealistic. The material is not difficult, but the workload is unbelievable. Take it with someone else.
Walked away with a B. I didn't do a single assignment. I did well on the 6 tests, and made sure to participate in class. I wouldn't recommend this professor to my worst enemy. The tests were unbelievably difficult, and quizzes were graded (in my opinion) far too strictly.
I just started Grad School and was thinking about Prof.Ishak. He was my toughest professor at GVSU but the only one who accurately prepared me for the workforce, and graduate school. I have no doubt that he is part of the reason I have excelled in my career thus far. He will help you-if you are willing to work hard to help yourself.
Assigns over 40 papers-not even a SWS class-that are worth maybe 2 points each. Doesn't teach anything and expects students to read and memorize the entire book
This class was way too much work! Assignments are lengthy and must be exactly the way he wants them.  I read the whole book front to back and had six exams throughout the semester.  I would never take a class with him as a professor again.
Avoid! Very demanding, rude, and makes you feel worthless. Class is a waste of time, and he does not teach a single thing. Memorize every word in the book for the tests. Assignments take forever to complete, but are barely worth any points. Take with another professor, it will save you a lot of stress.
Worst prof EVER! Just ridiculous! Demanding, hard to understand, confusing, argumentative, incredibly rude, not helpful, doesn't care about his students' success at all! You have to memorize the book to pass the 6 tests cuz he doesn't teach a thing! The class should be easy cuz the material is easy, but he makes it sooo difficult. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!
This was one of the hardest classes I have ever taken.  He was asking for an incredible amount of work for what should have been a fairly simple class.  I can't say I didn't learn anything but another prof would save you some sleepless nights and headaches
Worst professor I've ever had at GVSU. He's ****, admittedly dislikes other faculty members and speaks poorly of Grand Valley?s programs in general.  Only students with no mind of their own would give this guy a smiley face rating.","A nice guy, but a TERRIBLE professor. Assigns more assignments than I can count, and tests are EXTREMELY long.

196,"I really enjoyed having Davis! I will admit, sometimes the concepts in his lectures don't immediately click, but he is the most helpful if you go to office hours. I didn't understand how some concepts connected and he spent a hour with me visualizing and reviewing everything before the exam. His exams are not difficult-do the exam review materials.
Worst teacher ever. Doesnt teach well at all
This man, and understand I'm taking this class online during the pandemic so this might not be applicable if this lockdown gets resolved, but he is the singular worst teacher I've had in college. He simply is lazy and does not care one bit, he's recorded lectures are unacceptably horrid. Poor resolution and poorer audio quality. NEVER RESPONDS.
This quizzes this man gives are more about semantics than economics. They would be easy except he has to make the wording as complicated as possible for simple questions. His lectures are fine, nothing extraordinary.
Great prof, obviously very knowledgeable and wants to see students succeed. Teaches at a moderate-slow pace and will often review what you went over the week before. Ensures you're learning the ""why"" instead of just throwing equations at you. This material can be challenging but is IMPORTANT which is why it's helpful to have him as a professor.
Horrible Class. Exam average under 70% for all exams. All notes are handwritten during class, and his handwriting is illegible most of the time. Good luck if you miss a class, better have a friend who was there. Overcomplicates everything and asks VERY abstract conceptual questions for exams/online quizzes. Also no practice for quanitative problems
He's the chair of the department ,  and the person is so nice. His office hour is really really ... helpful, and he could explain very well when you ask him question. There are study questions before exams, and he allowed that use the final exam grade to replace one exam if you did not did well in first or second exam, and he gives review session.
Dr. Davis is a really nice and knowledgeable professor. He explains difficult theories clearly and show the complicated  models step-by-step. His office hour is also very helpful. Really enjoy this course.
Mr. Davis is a really fair and enjoyable teacher. He is thankfully not the typical ""watch a slide-show full of notes and copy it down"" teacher. He gives real life examples and has a good personality about it. His tests are fair and if you spend a couple good nights studying you will be fine. Also he is a very easy grader. Enjoyed this class
Took his class over winter term. Fast paced, and not necessarily easy, but I found that if you do the readings and practice exams everything becomes more clear. George is a genuine guy and willing to clarify if you need more help understanding something.
Mr. Davis is one of the best professor's I've had throughout Miami.  He's hard, but so helpful.  I went to his office hours once a week, asked questions, and got good answers.  I'm not good at Econ and I knew I wouldn't get an A from the start, but I know by going to his office hours it helped me from getting a D in that class.
Definitely a good professor. Gives a ""degree of difficulty"" adjustment on all exams (aka a huge curve, 15 points for the final) and gives practice exam questions before every test. Nice guy and willing to help. Aplia will boost your grade if you do it. Recommend!
Genuinely good dude.  He is the department head. Can be a bit bland at times, which causes me to lose interest.  His sense of humor will grow on you. Tests are tough, but manageable.
I did not enjoy this class. Lectures seem easy and boring, but then the tests are difficult, and he is a really picky grader.
He's the chair of the department and is like just about every other econ teacher at Miami because he likes to complicate easy concepts and have his TA's take off many points for small mistakes on his difficult tests. I probably could have done better if I worked a little harder, though, and he's a nice guy, so he might be your best option for 301.
Excellent teacher, I wish they all could be like this guy. Tests are difficult, and the essays require a lot of thinking. If you put in a lot of work you'll get a lot out of this class as well as a thorough understanding of money and banking.
Exams are straight from his notes, and none of his elaborate formulas are on there. As long as you listen in class, the exams aren't bad. His practice exams and review problems are almost verbatim on the tests. Just listen, take notes, and do the old/practice exams. Good teacher.
Very clear, great professor, you can really learn a lot from his class.  Sometimes gets carried away with derivations of formulas, but don't worry, they won't be on the test.","I really enjoyed having Davis!

197,"This class was super easy, you don't need the book if you take good notes (which aren't a lot with the course pack). Attendance wasn't mandatory at the beginning but then she realized everyone was skipping so made in class assignments and you had to do 9/13 to get full points and wouldn't email the study guide. I put in minimal effort and got an A.
She's a great prof. She asked us how she could improve the class halfway through the semester and changed everything up. She uses LearnSmart, so if you want to save money don't take her class. Otherwise, it's an interesting lecture class.
I really enjoyed this class... the material was very interesting (perhaps to me bc it's my major), the assignments were reasonable, and the professor was very considerate/flexible. She had several class meetings and the final online, which allowed many of us to save much time/gas $ bc it was @ GR's beltline. Highly recommend taking during Summer!
A really good learning environment, and a teacher who is up to date with the latest development in her field.
enjoyed the taste test.  went to office hours and got a lot of help.  wish she taught more undergrad classes
overall interesting examples. best professor I've had at WMU.  Go to class and you'll do well on tests.
EXTREMELY dull class. seriously boring. plus she had speaker trouble in the beginning which amplified her voice to painful levels. she has quizzes that border on pop, so you almost HAVE to attend the lectures... otherwise just buy the slide booklet and study the reviews she posts and you'll do fine.
Class was boring as hell. she tried to show clips to keep it interesting but just read from the slides the rest of the time. Really annoying voice and constantly tried to appeal to the males in the class. Tests arent bad as long as you study the slides. 7 random quizzes, she takes the best 5
Pretty standard lecture class. Less boring than most. Quite amusing prof.
The class is easy, you dont need to go to class she just gives you all the slides to study so its not that hard. She is kinda goofy and her lectures can get pretty boring but I didnt mind taking this class.
I really didn't like this class. I just don't like this subject. The professor is a very nice lady, and really REALLY knows about marketing. The projects were irritating i my opinion, I really didn't like doing them. I just dont like marketing, so this class was just annyoing to me. But the professor is very good.
This class should be an easy B if you go to class on a regular basis.  The quizzes are extremely easy and the two lowest scores are dropped.  The two big assignments are time consuming but are generally pretty easy points.  The exams are not as easy as you would think so you have to study hard for those. She is a very kind lady!
Her lectures are super boring, and will have you writing until the last minute of class.  She didnt post a study guide for the first test so I bombed it, but once she started posting them for the other 2 I got a BA in the class.  She offered a lot of Extra Credit and the in-class quizzes were easy. I recommend her but bring a pillow to class.
Kind of a weird lady but not a bad teacher overall. I got a CB and I spent most of the lecture snoring. Also do not buy the book, just get a course packet, show up for her easy quizes and do both simple projects she assigns, tests were moderate when I studied using the guide from web ct.
Overall not a bad class. As long as you read the coursepack, read the chapters and take certain notes from the book, you'll be ok. Def. use WebCT to make sure if she postes study guides for the exam. I got an overall BA, originally at a C.
Uses Powerpoint for lecture and rambles on about examples, makes class seem longer than it is.
Use the study notes she gives you from web ct for the exams and it will be the easiest class ever.  Thinks she is really cool and stuff...but her lectures are boring and she gives you all of her slides in a packet, so there is not point in going.  i rarely went to class and got a B
She's so funny and smart. I absolutely love her, she loves her job and makes the class very easy. You don't  even have to buy the book. Take her she's a great teacher! Honestly
Well, Roberta is certainly a piece of work. Kind of annoying the way she always references things she thinks young people are interested in to seem cool. I find it hard to keep focused in that class and she reads directly from the slides. Course pack has all slides and if you highlight and fill in extra notes, you'll be fine. Web CT used a lot.
Not that compassionate.  I had two surguries during her class and missed most of the material, but still managed to get a CB.  And the kicker is that she wouldn't give me and extra .6% to boost me to a B overall.  She's not that cool.","Her lectures are super boring, and will have you writing until the last minute of class.

201,"Doc Z was an excellent professor, and a good guy. Unfortunately, he passed a few months ago due to cancer. He was one of the greats at Otterbein, he will be missed.
One of the best teachers! He has great stories and keeps the course interesting. As long as you put in a little work you will have no trouble succeeding in this class.
This guy is happy to be teaching and seems to love his subject. He's more than fair on quizzes and tests, and will gladly help you with any issues you're having.
I love Doc. Z!! hes the only person who can keep me interested for 3 hrs at a time... best story teller and so funny
He is an extremely nice teacher and really cares about the subject matter he is teaching. I began to struggle on the tests in this class, but he was willing to work with me on improving my study methods and he helped to make me a better student overall. I enjoyed his class and would defnitely recommend him!!
Overall really good professor. He will do anything to help out his students when they are started to suffer in his class.
Awesome prof!!!  He can make almost any subject interesting.  Very helpful and understanding.  Taking another class because he is the prof...and I am interested in the subject.  Change to this prof if possible!!!
Good teacher, tests are kind of hard but a worthwhile experience
Great teacher, not much class discussions though, lots of reading
Dr. Z ROCKS! He will bend over backwards to help you out. Dedicated and caring. His classes are wonderful. Insightful and interesting. I wanted to come to class.
Best teacher at Otterbein hands down.  Amazing person and teacher.  I want to have his offspring.
AWESOME TEACHER!!!! Take any class that you can with him! Very funny!!! Great story teller!! keeps even the dullest things interesting!
Great teacher and a great guy!  Makes philosophy fun and pretty much TELLS you what is going to be on a test or quiz!

AWESOME CLASS AND PROFESSOR!
Great professor! A bit disorganized, but also willing to go into a direction that the class is interested in going. Provides great exercises for writing and good feedback. Will definitely take more classes with him.
He's completely scatter-brained and tends to pop up with random assignments that aren't on the syllabus, have nothing to do with the course, and aren't that hard to do - just time consuming. He also likes to throw in an extra book the first week (that you won't use!). All that said, he knows his stuff, can be very helpful.
A quirky prof. Not a hard grader, but really marks up your work, gives good feedback. Has intersting (colorful?) class discussions. Nothing is off limits or ""bad"". A fun INST class!
What a great prof!
Incredibly unorganized but he will make you work. Even though his exercises may seem pointless, they tend to be useful later.
OMG, what a blast! He makes class so much fun and he is such a goofy guy! It was GREAT! Would love to have more classes with him!
He was my advisor and after taking his Creativity and Writing class, I double-majored and quickly took every class he offered. No organization, but many times the disorganization is also the motivator for his themes and how he pushes you to write.
Bad Ass
He forces you to think and does things with imagination and enthusiasm!
He will stretch the imagination, but be prepared for disorganization.","Great professor! A bit disorganized, but also willing to go into a direction that the class is interested in going. Provides great exercises for writing and good feedback. Will definitely take more classes with him."
205,"TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN!! He is an amazing professor and very funny. 
Mark is the best and I loved him sense of humor. Super, super laid back. His quizzes/tests don't make you want to pull your hair out. If you go to class, he tells you EXACTLY what to study. Probably the easiest professor that I have ever had, but incredibly knowledgeable. He has the best of both worlds. Going to miss laughing in his class. :)
I LOVED Mark. He is super hilarious. He has these stories that he tells you throughout the semester. He also has a story about the life of BIG BOY. This class is super easy. All the exams are online. All the questions are from the bolded words in the chapter. He copies it word from word into the exam.
Amazing, 10/10 professor. He is so caring about all of his students during the pandemic. Super knowledgable too. If you receive the opportunity to take a class with him, I totally recommend it.
I love this professor and wish that I could have him as a prof for all of my bio classes. 100/10 recommend taking his classes! He is super sweet and funny, he is also very flexible and genuinely cares about his students!
Prof is Luttenton is such a sweet guy and really passionate about his profession! His exams are really easy mainly vocab from textbook and diagrams (he tells what to study for). His passion makes lectures engaging and interesting.
Prof Luttenton is super knowledgeable in biology and loves to share it. He is a good lecturer and helps you understand the topics. His hybrid class was only graded by exams and some quizzes but they were all super easy and he outlined what you need to know. I would suggest him for someone who isn't especially good at biology since he is so helpful.
Most laid back prof I have ever had. Tests and quizzes were mainly vocab straight from the book, and if it was anything otherwise, expectations were very clear. The only downside to this class is that there were few chances for points, so doing well on the exams and quizzes was important. Overall is a super cool guy. Even brought his dog in once!
Mark is a pretty laid back professor and very knowledgeable. It wasn't required to go to class, but I enjoyed going because his lectures are pretty interesting and he can be pretty funny. The tests are a combination of definitions from the book and some notes from class, not too hard. I took this as a gened class but I enjoyed it a lot.
All we were graded on was 2 quizzes and the exams, which were mostly truefalse and multiple choice (straight from book vocab), I wasn't always so sure what to study for the short answerdiagram section though, he wasn't very clear on what he expected from that. I always skipped class because it was at 8:30 but that didn't usually hurt me on tests.
Professor Luttenton is awesome.  Nearly all the test material comes from the bold face words in the text book, which is tedious, but super straight forward. No homework, two quizzes, and four exams. Lectures aren't that bad because he always manages to keep the topic interesting with stories and his great sense of humor! 
He's such a funny teacher. His texts and quizzes are super easy. Mostly truefalsemultiple choice. He tells you what you should know for the tests. Try to show up and take the notes because sometimes you have to know a diagram for a test and he won't tell you on blackboard.
I had him at 8 am, but he made lecture actually enjoyable. Very funny and nice. He was also very understanding and flexible when I was going through stuff that hindered my work ability in class. TAKE HIM!
He is extremely friendly and happy all the time.  Always jokes with students and makes class more interactive.  Tests are mostly memorization of a lot of material but they aren't too bad
Absolutely LOVE this guy! He is so smiley and friendly if you ever want to have someone make your day brighter you should go talk to him. He loves what he teaches and he is just so sweet! TAKE HIS CLASS!
AWESOME! He tells you exactly what to study! Exams are multiple choice, T/F, and 2-3 brief free response. Book is used for vocab only. Luttenton is a very friendly, laid back prof with plenty of stories to tell. Take any class with him!!!
Professor Luttenton was a very cool professor. Made coming to an 8am Biology class interesting. Test and quizzes were straight forward, but a lot of learning on your own out of textbook for tests.
Very down to earth Prof, definitely knows his algae! Very nice to talk to and very informative on a lot of topics. His teaching style is pretty traditional but he expects you to know your stuff! I would definitely reccomend if you need a plant course, or you want to make a friend!
Dr. Luttenton is a fantastic lecturer, and it's easy to do well in his class if you attend the lectures, and follow his direct instructions of what to study for the tests/quizzes. He's an expert, and his stories are fun. Top-notch prof!
AWESOME!!! Lecture is always a hoot! Take him if you get the chance!!! Very helpful with course work and tells you outright what he expects of students for exams. b/c of his relaxed teaching style it's much easier to absorb info, especially when tied to one of his hilarious stories. AWESOME!!! ps. you do need the book","Most laid back prof I have ever had. Tests and quizzes were mainly vocab straight from the book, and if it was anything otherwise, expectations were very clear. The only downside to this class is that there were few chances for points, so doing well on the exams and quizzes was important. Overall is a super cool guy. Even brought his dog in once!"
208,"Best Prof I have ever had! He is hilarious. Class is super easy,  he gives study guides for every exam (It's basically just the lecture outlines). There's no power points, he individually explains everything you need to know, with interesting real life examples. You right own research paper but it only needs to be two pages long. Take this class. 
He is not as easy as everyone says he is but he isn't too bad. He is a cool guy, has a lot of stories from being in the Secret Service. He is beyond helpful and as long as you pay attention in class you will do well. If I was a CJ major I would try to get him as much as possible because he is a great guy.
Extremely interesting and fun class! Professor Grossenbacher is by far the best professor I have ever had.  Keeps class very interesting with stories of his years in the secret service. Gives out study guides for tests which are extremely helpful.
Easy easy easy class! I highly suggest taking it, and with Grossenbacher. He is a great professor and makes the class interesting. Attendance isn't mandatory but I always wanted to go to class and learn more. Don't buy the book, I got an A in the class and didn't use it
Professor Grossenbacher was the best! Easy tests, all multiple choice/true false. He makes study guides, and tells great stories about his 30 years experience in the secret service. He's a great professor, take him if you can! He makes me happy I chose this as my major.
This professor was my absolute favorite this semester. He makes this class really interesting and always makes sure that his students get everything he's teaching. A genuinely nice guy and has great stories from his 30 year career in the Secret Service. He's inspired me to pursue a career in criminal justice.
Prof Grossenbacher is an awesome prof.  He is very good about answering questions and clarity.  He's not unfair and what he says will be on the tests is actually there and there are no surprises!! He's an amazing prof! TAKE HIM!!
Awesome class. Awesome Prof. Very friendly, educated, great guy. HAs a great teaching personality which makes an already interesting class even better. Must take!
Great Professor. Wants his students to understand the material, answers questions that the students have. I don't recommend buying the book. I got A's on my tests without reading it. He also tells interesting stories about the Secret Service and responds to emails promptly. Take him if you can.
Awesome professor, made the class so interesting with his stories from the Secret Service. He really wants you to understand the material and explains things really well. Never read the book and got high b's on the exam and aced the paper.
DG is a great instructor!  He used to be in the Secret Service and it passionate about Criminal Justice and really wants you to understand what he's teaching.  He's funny and tells cool stories about when he was in the Secret Service.  Really fun guy, you should get him if you can!
I love this teacher!! He's always so exicited to teach the class, and I have learned soo much! For all you CJ majors, you have to have this teacher because you will learn so much. :)
I loved this professor! He is very knowledgable in the subject and has great stories as a former member of the Secret Service. I had some family issues during the semester that made me miss class and he was very understanding and gave me plenty of time to make up the work.
Very good teacher, has a lot of background and the best stories.  He hopes everyone the best and is very helpful.  Take notes and do your study guides, you will be fine if you do that.  Great choice for cj classes.
After this semester, he's one of my favorite profesors, i was sad for the class to end. Good guy, great teacher. Definitely wants everyone to do well. Plus, he has awesome stories. If you have the opportunity take his class.
I'm an international student and this is my first semester at grand valley , my english is still weak, but I got A in this class ,, professor Grossenbacher is the best
best professor for CJ. He's so intelligent and has such great stories that relate to each topic. Such an enjoyable class. MUST get him if you can. No homework, tests are so easy, and the final wasn't cumulative.
Definitely try to get this professor!!! He is great. A retired secret service agent with many interesting and relevant stories to add. His exams are pretty easy just multiple choice and t/f and he gives great review sheets. he is very helpful and understanding. Loved his class.
Well this was an easy class, but I really liked the class and definitely the professor. He had many Secret Service stories and had a twisted sense of humor that I liked, also he mentioned the Sopranos in class, which is always a good thing. The tests aren't too bad at all and he grades easily on the paper if you follow directions, take himforCJ 101
Grossenbacher is the best! Get this prof if you can. Very helpful, he wants you to do good in his class. His stories about the Secret Service are so cool. Only 3 tests, 1 final, and one small paper (2 pages). You will not regret taking this class!","DG is a great instructor!  He used to be in the Secret Service and it passionate about Criminal Justice and really wants you to understand what he's teaching.  He's funny and tells cool stories about when he was in the Secret Service.  Really fun guy, you should get him if you can!"
210,"Prof Klingler is a teacher who cares about his students learning and development. His excitement for math got his students excited. Need more like prof Klingler.
Great Professor, which I could have Dr Klingler for every Math Class
All of his stuff is open note open partner besides the tests which are just open note. He is a very sarcastic guy and if you can't handle that don't take him. You do have to go to class for a small portion of your grade. Overall I highly recommend
Makes you do webwork. However, every quiz is open note plus can be worked on with partners. Every test is also open note but test are completed by yourself. Im not very good at math and I still received an A. He is kind of boring to listen to but very nice. He offers extra credit too(a lot) and his grading scale is to the students advantage.
Quizzes you can work together on, tests are open note. Lots of homework but it's easy and you go over it every week. He sometimes talks about other students when they're absent but not in a mean way.
I loved this class and this professor. You must to show up to class because he gives attendance points and participation points. He is very good about giving out extra credit and posting stuff that he does in class in case you miss something you can just get it off blackboard. He was very good about extending homework if needed. Highly recommend.
gives a lot of extra credit. not very good at teaching. many small quizzes, all take home, can work on with other people. his homework he gives out is much harder than in class tests. everything, including final is open book open note. easily gets off topic. cant read his handwriting. handouts that are done in class are helpful while taking tests
If you struggle with math don't take professor klingler. I really struggled with math and he did not make the class interesting or easy to understand for me. However, if you do not struggle with math this class will be an easy A.
Super easy prof! Definitely recommend him to anyone! Talks a bit much and doesn't deal with disrespectful students. Tests/final are open notes and quizzes you can work with other people on them. Gives out a ton of extra credit opportunities. Great prof!
GREAT prof! He is very helpful and all his exams (including the final) you get to use your notes. Also, you get to work with others on quizzes. Attend class and you will be fine.
only thing about this class that was annoying was the fact that I bought the textbook, which we didn't use all year. so don't buy it! really nice guy and is helpful and appreciates being asked questions after class/during office hours. sometimes is a little rude and talks about students grades in front of the class, but not in a mean way.
Klingler is very kind and caring, always eager to help his students. His work was all online with tutorials on how to do the problem which were very beneficial. He's very generous with points and is always trying to help students succeed and make class enjoyable. He's a fair teacher and easy-grader. He also let us use notes on quizes and exams.
Great Professor! Not a difficult class. He will give out study guides for tests as well as extra credit. Very nice as well.
He's one of the best professors I've had so far. He gives A LOT of extra credit questions. He also give very helpful handouts that could lead you to getting a very good grade in the course. His quizzes and exams are all open book which is an advantage. He tells interesting stories about his life. I would definitely take this professor again!
He is very nice. Sometimes he talks a little too much, but his stories are mostly interesting. I learned in the class and I liked it.
LOVED this teacher. He is older so he has stories he likes to tell but he explains the math in such an easy way you don't struggle! NO book needed, it's online. Tests are open book/notes, quizzes can be worked in groups. Easy class but you also learn. I love math now because of this prof!
Treated us like we were in elementary school. Attendance counts towards grade which i thought was stupid, as well as participation. Easy class but you'd learn more yourself from him
He was really easy and I had not problem passing.  A lot of the time he was very rude and treated his students like children.  I felt I was not respected and felt he often mocked me.  If you want someone easy go ahead and take him but I would not recommend him to anyone.
His tests are open book/open note- MAJOR plus. If you go to his office hours, he is extremely helpful, and will tell you pretty much exactly what to expect on his tests. Be careful not to ignore the seemingly pointless worksheets, though- it'll pull your grade down, if you don't turn them in.
Great professor. Looks like santa clause. I got a 103% in the class, and learned so much while not putting too much work into the class. Take him!","LOVED this teacher. He is older so he has stories he likes to tell but he explains the math in such an easy way you don't struggle! NO book needed, it's online.

211,"Do not take this class, or this professor for anything. If you have to pick between Burg and Kurjiaka though, pick Burg. 
Its possible to get an A, just for maybe a handful of students. You either need to be gifted or studying for at least 4-5 hours a day to receive a good grade. He believes in one learning style and believes that students that dont that dont watch his hours of lectures outside of class to prepare for the class dont want to succeed. Heavy course.
The majority of the ratings on Prof. Burg are from the uncommitted. Put in work and its not that hard to get an A. Requires maybe 6 hours a week of studying. Hypes up the tests like they are going to be hard but they end up being very simple and straight forward. Skipped multiple classes and still ended up with over 100% in the class.
Professor Burg was extremely rude and made this subject way more harder than it had to be. Yes I understand this class was never supposed to be a cake walk however, he turned one of my most favorite subject and made me hate it. Has no empathy whatsoever, makes you feel dumb and his lecture videos were so boring. He even threatened our careers.
Professor burg has been my worst professor in college. He expects you to watch 2+ hr lectures a week and attend class in which both he reads directly off of the slides. He gets mad when people dont ask questions but makes you feel stupid if you do. He is rarely on topic, talks about himself a lot, mumbles, and is extremely cocky. Switch out!
In person discussions were a waste of time. Someone would ask a question and he would never answer it yet talk for 10 minutes. During a discussion he asked if I had started the hw that was due in four days, I said no. He told me that I should be more on track and scolded me in front of everyone. He is much more patient with his white students.
DON'T TAKE HIM. In lecture, he just reads the slides word for word. His lectures are so hard to pay attention to because he makes it so boring. When you want to ask him a question he's very rude about it and makes you feel dumb. He expects all of his students to be geniuses. His tests are also very difficult & have mostly written parts.
Prof. Burg is very quiet in his lectures and mumbles often. I sat in the 5th row of the lecture hall and had a very hard time hearing him speak. He is very accessible to his students but when I asked him questions I oftentimes felt he was too smart to put the material into simpler terms for me. Be prepared to study A LOT.
Exams are pretty tough and very detailed. Lectures can be pretty boring and often go on a tangent. I personally just didnt enjoy him as a professor.
Martin Burg was the worst professor I have ever had at GVSU. He expected us to be all knowing and marked down everything he could. He told me I should study harder and spend more time studying when I went to him but I had a tutor, study group, and studied more than any other class. He only cares about his flies. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! He ruined me.
DO NOT take Burg! He was by far the worst professor I have ever had at gvsu. His lectures are beyond boring, as he reads his slides word for word in a monotone voice. When it comes to the tests, he expects you to be a genius and the exams are very difficult. He is very rude to his students and he is not very helpful during his office hours.
DON'T DO IT. You can tell that Burg is very smart, but is a terrible professor. He has four exams throughout the semester, and all of them have very low class averages. They are extremely specific, and if you don't write exactly what he wants to hear in the essay questions, he won't give you credit. I recommend finding someone else for physiology.
Wow, this class was the hardest class I have taken. Prof. Burg's lectures are so heavy and wordy that it is hard to focus. Although most dates are stated in the syllabus, he does not remind you of due dates for assignments so BE AWARE ! Exam's are about 40% multiple choice and 60% short answer/ essay, this is what hurt my grade the most.
His tests are insane difficult. Got a D on every single exam and cried in his office multiple times. Would not recommend.
I came into this class after reading prior ratings thinking he would be awful. He definitely has improved this year. He uses fill ins on his slideshows but you can only see them if you show up to class. His lectures are everywhere though so you're better to just read the book. Heavy tests but a few HW assignments help. Extra credit is offered.
Literally the worst professor, extremely rude and horrible at explaining. Avoid him at all costs. Doing better in orgo than his class.
He is a chemistry professor teaching physiology and that is very evident. Very, very hard and boring.
one of the worst prof's Ive ever had.
This class was AMAZING!!! Dr. Burg won't take your crap but makes sure you know the material and will give you research opportunities. Great introduction to research projects and genomics. You are not actually working with flies.
Would never take a class with him again","DON'T TAKE HIM. In lecture, he just reads the slides word for word. His lectures are so hard to pay attention to because he makes it so boring.

215,"Dr. Hrinca is a professor who knows his stuff, but oh my god is it hard to understand. Math is not my thing and having never taken a calc class before I wish I didn't have Hrinca. He is great guy, super understanding, and wants to help his students but I can't even understand what we're doing to ask questions.
I loved this class. Prof Hrinca was very understanding of accommodations, and quick to respond. We had 3 grades: 2 exams and the final. That was it. And it was great. You had 7 days to complete each exam/final, they were open note, and you were encouraged to collab with classmates.
I had this professor entirely online. Maybe he's a better teacher in person, but I got nothing from his lectures. It was near impossible to figure out what was due and when because he posted next to nothing to Blackboard. He yelled at students for getting things wrong and generally made me not want to participate in class ever.
Very outgoing and loves his studies, but his lectures were hard to sit through sometimes. He'd sometimes be really funny or he'd make kids participate. Somewhat difficult grader but not the worst math class I've ever taken.
Hrinca is the worst. Literally have to teach the entire course to yourself. He only reviews homework in class, you literally have to read the textbook and teach yourself the math, he does almost zero lecture in class, just pop quizzes and answers questions.
Very easy class, professor is kind of a character but is very understanding. An overall good class!
He's an amazing teacher who genuinely cares about his students and their success. I was scared going into the class because at first he seemed strict, but I easily passed. Anyone could take this class and get a satisfactory grade if they put at least half-effort into it.
Dr. Hrinca is very intelligent and passionate about math, but that NEVER translates into his lectures, which are incredibly slow, boring, and rambling often going on long tangents. Gives unclear instructions and assignments, often forgetting about them, randomly demanding them, or changing the instructions. Gets mad at students for not loving math
Such an easy A!!! On the final he asks you what grade you deserve and just hype yourself up and he'll give it to you! Not an interesting class at all but cant complain because it was so easy!
Dr. Hrinca has to be one of the most memorable professors I've had at Otterbein. He genuinely cares about each and every one of his students, and if you just show up to class and participate you will get an A.
SUCH AN EASY CLASS. Lets you grade yourself on the final, and on tests. Super laxed. Definitely not the best at teaching but knows his stuff and is super understanding. Just go to class and you'll get at least a B.
Hrinca is great! Super understanding guy, makes you participate in class, is willing to spend time clarifying subjects and encourages students to help each other out. Projects/journals are a great way to boost your grade in the class.
If you fear mathematics but are open minded,  this is the class for you. Dr.. Hrinca will help you  build the confidence needed to  learn math concepts  and be successful. 
He knows his stuff, but is terrible at teaching it
Stats was pretty easy . Hrinca is a great guy with a unique sense of humor. Go to class and listen and you should do fine. DO NOT TEXT IN CLASS he will kick you out.
Wonderful Prof! Knows his subject matter very well and cares deeply about his students. Great sense of humor - very understanding if you have to turn in an assignment late now and then. Don't miss his lectures,as most of the course content comes during class, not the text. Reasonable workload. Show up, pay attention participate & you'll do well!
Dr. Hrinka's awesome. He's very smart and as long as you show up and try hard, he'll give you an A.
Best guy ever! Truly cares about his students, takes time out of his own day to call each student to let them know how they're doing, good and bad. Definitely recommend!
This guy is one of the best teachers ever! Enough said. And his enthusiasm is inspiring!
Best teacher I have ever had. Very knowledgeable, understanding, passionate about math.  I struggle with Math but he made class fun and easy to understand. He does expect you to participate in class, however, a good attitude can get you a FAR FAR way in his class. Very generous grader.","SUCH AN EASY CLASS. Lets you grade yourself on the final, and on tests. Super laxed. Definitely not the best at teaching but knows his stuff and is super understanding. Just go to class and you'll get at least a B."
216,"Travis was the best. Creative instructor who respects his students.
This guy blew my mind. Such a great lecturer. Loved the course.
He was a great teacher. Worksheets and textbooks are not what defines a great teacher. Either is the workload. At the end of the day; what did you learn? I learned a ton. Thank you Prof. Travis.
He's a funny guy. Uses visualaides a lot, tells you when quizzes will be. Makes jokes, reminds you when things are due.. and he tries to keep it as fun as possible, but its history... Exams are easy. Listen to what he says, and take notes, then you wont have to look things up for the exam. Easy laid back guy! Take him!!!!
Dont listen to the last comment, you'll be happy you took him.  Very easy grader, long as you go to class and do the very light reading assgments, you can sit back and watch videos in the classroom, and collect your A.  Overall I'd take him for every class if i could, funny guy, laid back, nice and has no problem giving you a good grade.
Without a doubt worst prof ever. Colleges think he is a joke. Uses ****ing YouTube, & movies to teach. Seriously do not take this guy. He gives GVSU a bad name. I would expect better at a CC. I am getting pissed just writing this. What a ****ing moron. He loves Gangs of New York, thinks it is historically pertinent. I paid to be taught by Scorsese?
Funny guy, class is a bit boring, but he does make you laugh.. Lots of visuals, hardly any homework... Keep up with your blogs! He makes history as interesting as this stuff can be!
Very good teacher all around. Good grading system and exam. Not boring, very energetic!! Hope to have again, but he will be leaving next year.
He was boring and very unclear of what he expected from the students. He was very unhelpful when asked questions.
Love all the visual material that makes class interesting
Honestly this was an easy class to get by in without doing much although my grade only came out with about a C.  Only work done in class is a 300 word journal summary of the week's lecture and a midterm and final done online but he gives you the questions done ahead of time. He is kind of a tough grader and this class is so boring!!!
Very nice professor. He made History a little bit more interesting by telling facts that aren't normally brought up and everything is online!
VERY nice, understanding, friendly, helpful, funny and clear. He makes history easy and bring up facts that are usually left out but very interesting. One-of-a-kind professor, HIGHLY recommended.
Wonderful Prof! He is very passionate and knowledgeable, and does a good job of keeping you interested.  Some days are more exciting than others, but overall excellent!
Travis was a great prof if you don't like history.  EVERYTHING is online, so its not critical to go to class, but he is very helpful in explaining things if you do.  No assignments, just essays for the mid-term and final.  Plus, he's a really nice guy... I would recommend him.
Easy class if you at least try to attend.  No quizzes or homework or reading.  Graded on Midterm and Final, both of which are essay, but he gives you the questions on the first day.  Also must complete a short journal for each day.  Not too bad.  He's pretty funny sometimes too. Take him=U do good.
Good prof, nice and funny, lots of videos and movies, he has online reading on the syllabus, but I only read the textbook and did fine.  Write a paper and two take home exam things. Ok class, prof is easy if you do what he asks.
Very nice and laid back. He lectures alot but if you take good notes the class is pretty fun and managable.
He is a fun professor!  he is very laid back and flexible.  lectures can get boring b/c he talks mostly all hour, but not all are like that.  he uses movies and music a lot.  his exams are all essay, which are on BB and he gives you the exact questions before hand.  Excelent!  I would suggest him!!
Nice Professor.  He makes history interesting.  Great use of media.  Once questions are available on BB for the midterm and final,it is helpful to prepare ahead of time.  He starts posting the questions 2 or 3 weeks before the exam.  You can then paste your answers at exam time.","Nice Professor.  He makes history interesting.  Great use of media.

218,"She tells great stories from her childhood in Spain and she has a great sense of humor.
I'm a Spanish minor and I found this class very fun.  Her stories are hilarious, and if you take good notes and attend most lectures, you will do well. You will not know your grade, but you can guess based on participation and the exams she gives back graded.  She is willing to help after class as well.
She doesn't post your grades, but if you participate (definitely speak up!) and take good notes you will do well.  Her stories are hilarious, and you will not be bored.  She was always willing to talk after class about anything confusing.  If it fits into your schedule, definitely choose this professor for this class.
She's tough. She's abrasive.  She's a little crazy. If you're a major and ready to get down to business, she will open up and be ready to work with you at any time of day on any topic. If you're not into Spanish, she'll be able to tell, and she will eat you up. If you want to learn, you will learn a LOT. For those faint of heart, find someone else.
THE BEST!! She is such a knowledgeable woman that goes beyond what needs to be taught and teaches everyone life lessons while doing her everyday teaching. All you really need to do is pay attention and read the material that is in the syllabus, she gives out pretty straightforward exam practices and all you gotta do is study from them.
She is insane.  There is no other way to put it.  You cannot talk to her and she does all your grades by memory, not writing anything down.  So at the end she just thinks up a grade for you.  She won't know anyone's name throughout the semester so go figure on how she comes up with a participation grade for you.  She majorly wastes class time.
Take this one with a grain of salt because she wasn't very fond of our class. Make sure you participate!!!! You won't have a good idea of your grade throughout the semester. She is helpful if you have issues with a paper. Her study guides were helpful as well.
She's fantastic! We didn't really follow the syllabus, but she was a wealth of knowledge. Not to mention that she's hilarious and made us homemade paella for the last day of class. I enjoyed her throughly.
She is the BEST... Loved her lectures entertaining, down to earth, just the BEST
Just like most Spanish classes, you never follow the syllabus, just make sure you listen in class to know what's going on.  Very interesting prof.  Good stories. Very approachable.  Supposed to speak only Spanish but would talk in English if class didn't understand the concept.  Keep up on reading, come to class and participate and you'll get an A.
This class was really easy.  She tells you to read a lot of stuff, but then goes over it in class.  Make sure you proofread your papers and you'll get A's on them.  She tries to make class as interesting as she can. Make sure you participate in class and you'll be fine.  Class isn't too hard to get a good grade in, just put forth a little effort.
Loved her! She's like a mom. She made me want to keep on learning spanish. Very funny and fiesty! Very little homework assigned other than memorization. Has you practice in claass which is very helpful. Helped me understand english grammar as much as spanish. Looked forward to going to class.
She says whatever is on her mind, good or bad. I felt intimidated to participate b/c she humiliated many other students. If you have bad grammar, she announces it to the whole class. Funny, helpful, caring, intelligent, but she doesn't think before she speaks and she ends up hurting a lot of people
I love her!  She is one of my favorite professors here.  She can be intimidating at first.  Her classes are not for the weak.  Do you work and participate and she's great about helping you whenever you need it. I'll miss her while she's gone.  I'd definitely recommend her.
I am SO sad that she's going on sabbatical! Fernandez is a great professor; I have had her now for three classes and she gets better every time - she loves to teach, she loves literature, and she will CRACK you up! Take her! Of course, you'll have to wait until winter of 2006...boo for you!
Laughed my butt off; she's one of those profs who's been teaching for a while and says whatever she wants. She is knowledgeable, however, and even though she can seem a bit abrasive, the class is pretty easy and she tells great stories.
Her bark is worse than her bite. She scared the crap out of me at the beginning out of the class, but she's not bad at all - she's actually quite funny. Just be respectful and participate in class. I hope to have her again.
She is a great professor. She tells it like it is! She is so much fun!  Go to class, do the work and talk in class and you will do just fine!!!
Loved her! Very clear, willing to help, super easy exams! Funny in a strange way but very funny. Great Professor. One of the greatest
She is a kind person and knows what she teaches, though her method of grading is questionable. Make sure you keep tabs on your grades, she isn't very organized.","I'm a Spanish minor and I found this class very fun.

220,"There's a reason that Professor White is one of Grand Valley's highest-rated professors. This class was one of the hardest ones I've ever taken because I did not take it as seriously as I should have or prioritized my unit plan (DO NOT PROCRASTINATE ON THE UNIT PLAN). He's a gem.
He truly cares about all of his students and wants to see them become amazing teachers. He tries to give his students real experience with teaching by setting up volunteering in schools and by giving real papers to grade. He gives great lectures that make you realize how you want to teach. Homework is pretty light and resembles what a teacher does.
This Professor is AWESOME! He's my favorite because he gives you good feedback and make learning in his class very meaningful and engaging. He's gives fair clemency on legitimate circumstances, but don't think for a second your going to take advantage of his kindness, for it won't be very useful to do so.
Professor White has been my best college professor so far. I injured my ankle during the semester and he worked to create a new course work to make it easier for me due to my dificulty  getting to class. Amazing prof that really knows how to teach.
Best teacher I have ever had. Would take again in a heartbeat.
Brian White is an amazing professor and teaches his students to become better educators and people.  I feel more prepared to be a teacher after this class and feel so lucky to have had him.  Though it is challenging and most students do not receive A's, he provides so much more than  GPA boost.  Definitely recommend.
Prof. White prepares you to be a teacher. His uses open dialogue and class participation to get you to think more deeply about teaching as an art. If you can take his class, do so. You will gain so much. 
Professor White will inspire you to be the best teacher you can be. This class was extremely challenging and stressful; however, I have benefitted so much from Professor White. I recommend meeting with him any chance you get. His feedback is clear and helpful. Wonderful professor. Highly, highly recommend!
Highly recommend this professor for any English education capstone student. He is very knowledgeable about education, writing and more. The assignments are tough, and he grades hard, but that is to be expected for a capstone course. Best advice is to meet with him any chance you can. He is so helpful and gives wonderful, constructive feedback.
Brian genuinely cares about his students. He pushed us to problem-solve rather than simply ""answering"" our questions, and demonstrated tremendous expertise as an English teacher! He gave excellent feedback after observations; critical, but helpful at the same time because his goal was to make me the best teacher possible. Highly Recommended!
He is the best professor around and he helps everyone. His lectures are really awesome. He is one of the kindest and best professor in GVSU.
Professor White has very high expectations, but also gives clear feedback.  I think this class was practical and useful, but also very stressful.  Don't wait until the last minute to work on your unit plan!
It doesn't get better than Brian White! He establishes a great classroom atmosphere and day one, and enlightens students each and every day. He tells you the truth about things, not sugar coated versions of what people want you to think. It was a LOT of hard work, but you come out of this class more prepared as a profession and as a human being.:-)
Prof. White is one of the best profs I have ever had. This class completely changed the way I looked at teaching literature. There is a TON of work and he has extremely high expectations but you will end up with some really useful unit plans. If you want to be an English teacher, take this class!!!
The best professor I have ever had.  He changed the way I look at the idea of teaching and in doing so changed my life.  TAKE HIM.  He is demanding, but he will push you to do things you didn't know you were capable of.  After taking him, I was (and am) proud of everything I learned and accomplished in that class! Looked forward to class every day.
Hands down, the best professor in the English department (and possibly the university). Not only did I switch my major to English from Social Studies, but I have a notebook full of activities, lesson plan ideas, and unit plan outlines to use. I feel like I could start teaching tomorrow with the knowledge and materials gained from 311. Take him!
Prof. White is amazing. His class is tough, and takes a lot of work, but it's almost as it doesn't even matter. He makes you make sure that you do everything in teaching literature for a reason, and overall he's just brilliant. Highly recommended.
A really great professor, but he is difficult as hell! Be prepared to do more work than you ever have before. However, even though he is really tough, he is so nice, helpful, and funny...and that makes him worth taking!
Brian is an awesome professor. This class was ridiculously hard, but ridiculously amazing at the same time. If you put forth the effort (and don't skip classes) you'll be fine. Highly recommend.
Very knowledgeable about the material and urges students to help each other. Won't spoon-feed you the information by any means, but will strive to help you understand it in class. Not lenient at all about missing class and late assignments/extensions, even in emergencies...gives really good feedback/suggestions if you take the time to communicate!","Brian genuinely cares about his students.

223,"Not bad, not great. Dr. Hong is a little condensending to students. Not the hardest class but not a blow off class either.
Professor Hong was pretty alright overall. His accent really isn't too hard to understand. His tests are easy, but make sure you go to class because he'll essentially tell you what's going to be on them. I didn't open the book once, so don't bother buying it. He tends to be pretty condescending when you go to him for help though.
A lot of labs and they are due at the end of class. If you are more slow-paced than others, do not expect that he will let you turn it in during office hours for full points. I always did labs beforehand outside of class since all you need to know is in the coursepack. I showed up to turn in labs and leave. Take a different professor if you can.
Very difficult to understand. Gives very surface level explanations and makes you figure the concepts out yourself on the homework. Does not usually let you ask homework questions until after it's turned in.
No need for book. Best stats professor ever! Always has time for his students.. even leaves his office open during lunch. Very fair grader and can argue your grade. Go to office hours to check projects and you will always do well. I got a 98% in his class and its the only stats class I really learned from. Don't miss class Hard projects & easy exam
Very fair and helpful prof; not that aproachable at first though. He can explain things well but can also be condescending. Just listen and keep asking questions.
Great professor and a nice guy.  I am not a math wiz by any means and I pulled of an A- in his class.  Just listen and ask for help if needed.  He does an EXCELLENT job in explaining 'difficult' concepts in a relatively easy and understandable way which i think is the best thing about him.  If you suck at math and need STATS215, i recommend him
Prof. Hong is an excellent professor.  He explains what he wants, and gives you the tools needed to do the projects, and if turned in on time, grades pretty easily.  He also responds unusually quickly to emails.  Not a lazy professor by any means.
Soon is awesome. Very clear in what he wants and how to do assignments. He does NOT take late assignments, so be sure to get them in on time. Made me want to switch to a stats minor. Don't believe the BS about not being able to understand him. He speaks perfect English, just with an accent.
Wonderful teacher. His English is perfectly fine, regardless of what others have said, but he's Korean and he has a Seoul accent.  He's very helpful, replies to emails promptly and will answer all questions you have. Tests are easy if you've done your homework and paid attention.  let you use a sheet of equations on tests.
Cannot understand him!!
Difficult concepts, doesnt have the best English skills, Will help you in and out of class but is condensending, or makes you feel dumb, which is very frustrating!
I really enjoyed professor Hong. His lectures went by quick and although he has an accent, he was fairly easy to understand. Overall the class was pretty easy as long as you went to lab.
I could not understand this teacher at all. When you ask him something he makes you feel dumb and can't even answer. The lab quizzes are unneccessary but there are a ton of them. don't take this prof..most are easier!!
Prof. Hong was pretty easy. Sometimes he's hard to understand, but when it came to the homework, he pretty much gave the answers. He lets you use your condensed notes on a sheet of paper for the quizzes and final.
You should feel lucky you don't want to kill yourself after having Hong.He makes you feel like such a failure and says ""why don't you don't know that?!"" when you ask a question.When we came to class,he wanted us to tell him what we read in the book; he never lectured, just asked us questions and told us we were wrong constantly.VERY unfair grading.
I didn't like stats that much and this prof didn't really help. If you ask a question he makes fun of you. I was fairly lost with the new material but eventually it makes sense.  The tests are fairly easy but there are like 3 or 4 questions that he never went over.
Prof. Hong is a pretty funny guy. 215 is an extremely easy class. always study his lecture foci and the book. i found his lecture worthless. The lab work was almost always really easy. overall I'd recommend him.
I understood more from the book, than I did from him or attending class.
You probably wont understand the first or second day of each chapter, but make sure you still take notes on the gibberish, it will make sense later! If you do the homework and know the worksheets he passes out in class, youll ace the tests if you are decently smart. He does enjoy making fun of people who asks questions he deems as stupid.","Wonderful teacher.

224,"dont worry everyone shes retiring so you guys are all lucky and dont have to deal with her
do not take Helen Klein, she does not know how to use even the simplest technology, and shes teaching a technology based course. her lectures are not clear at all, and her exams are extremely tough. take both MGT 480's instead of taking MGT 475.
This lady is no good. She makes things so confusing and doesn't know how to properly teach or grade. She makes the students do work without ever teaching it. Awful. Grading system is terrible, doesn't teach anything so you have no clue what to expect but then she is an incredibly particular grader. Quizzes are bad, from the book without the info.
Honestly, just a really bad professor. She is a genuinely nice lady, she just doesn't really know what she's doing. Just seemed clueless a lot and taught myself most of the stuff including SAP. Somehow. I don't know. I'd definitely avoid her
She is a interesting professor in her own way. She knows the material but has a hard time displaying. Be ready to teach yourself. Do the exercises so you can be ready for the final project. Seek the ERP interns if you need more help. Best of luck and stress.
Worse teacher at GVSU. Is NOT helpful at all & loves to use the ""in the real world"" to cover up the fact that she will not help. Has little to no knowledge of SAP. Unfortunately she is the only instructor for this class.
Truly awful teacher, possibly the worst I've had at GVSU. She spends the whole class time talking about pointless topics and then puts together incredibly hard tests with questions that seem to come out of nowhere. She assigns projects without explaining how to do them, and takes off points without justification. Avoid her at all costs!
Horrible Teacher. Do not take her. , Waves around her masters that she received 30 yrs ago, as if that qualifies her as a good teacher. She has no clue how to use a computer, which is a problem considering it is completely a computer based class. She is ambiguous,  and has an unorthodox grading style, she doesn't even know what she wants.
Do not take MGT 268 with Klein. She is truly an awful professor. This class would be a blow off class with most teachers however due to Kleins ambiguous teaching style it is not. She is a teacher that hides behind her 30 year U of M diploma and says ""see I am smart."" If you are not aware MGT 268 is a computer based class, unfortunately computers fr
Do not let her be your professor. She understands little to nothing of the course material and can't answer student's questions. The notes she gave us were scattered, incomprehensible, and useless in studying for her exceptionally difficult midterm/final (sh*t study guilds too). She gets mad at students when no one understands what she's ""teaching""
Poor teaching. Tests at times will not match what is taught in class. Stay away!! Very poor professer.
I wouldn't recommend anyone to take her. She is not helpful and really doesn't know the material.
Run for the hills. Not helpful at all.
She is aweful, and has no clue about anything with the topic.
Her lectures are very boring and the class may seem easy but her test are kind of difficult. Make sure to study power points because she puts every thing on test even if it doesn't seem important.
Her class was very confusing at times. She was very confusing when using SAP in class. Her projects were challenging and appropriate. Her exams were very difficult they are short answer or fill in the blank. Many answers were subjective so it was hard to know what she was looking for in a correct answer. I would not take her again if I had a choice
RUN AWAY! Take any other teacher but her. She assigns projects on computer programs assuming you already know how to use them. She doesn't help at all if you have questions. She thinks she's helping, but she's pretty useless. There are barely any instructions to assignments, and when their are parts are usually missing leaving the class frustrated.
She is a great person but she is always struggling with the computer, she assigns several assignments at a time with two days to do them, and the tests are REALLY hard.  The class, in general, is really boring.  The plus side is that you're in a computer lab every day so you can do other things while she's talking.
No book for this course. Some test questions come out of no where. Overall i would say she is a pretty good teacher.
She's a really nice lady; but she's pretty useless.  She doesn't know the software at all; that or she just can't teach.  Spent way too much time on access and not on SAP.  Believes that our generations is lazy and made us do a paper on it.  I'd take someone else if you're interested in learning.  Watch out on tests - they are VERY DETAILED.","This lady is no good.

225,"Professor Boelkins is a pretty good prof! I will say it took me some adjusting to get used to his teaching style. He definitely focusing more on getting us students to explore the material on our own, rather than just giving a lecture. I personally would have liked more lectures but I know it helps us learn more. Also lots of HW, but he is nice!
Top notch prof, arguably the best in the math department. Makes expectations very clear and gives you a fair chance at meeting his learning targets several times. Practical and inspirational, helps you balance personal life and school work. 
Doctor Boelkins has mastered the art of the mastery grading system. This class is very low stress. Doctor Boelkins makes himself readily available outside of class and is phenomenal at explaining the complex concepts presented in this course.
he would sit down with me every one of his office hours and single-handed got me interested in math, best professor at gvsu, hands down
SUPER nice guy! He's very passionate about mathematics and inspires you to love math too. Very reasonable expectations for class. You will do great in this class if you show up and put effort in. He wants his students to succeed. He's very well respected for a very good reason.
Professor Boelkins is the best. All of the hw and quizzes are revisable and graded on a ""Mastered"" or ""Not Yet"" scale. His lectures are super interactive and easy to follow. He genuinely cares about every student and will help in any way that he can. He also really encouraged us to meet people in our class and I made a couple good friends.
Professor B was my favorite professor ever. He genuinely cares about his students and helps you actually learn the material and not just memorize it. His teaching style is very interactive and easy to follow along. He always asked if we understood or if we needed him to go back. Literally take him, he is the best. Made calc a 10/10 experience.
He is the professor that wrote the book for MTH 201 and MTH 202, so he is very knowledgeable on the subject. He lectures very well, stays organized, and grades assignments very quickly. Can be a pretty harsh grader, but he allows for one redo per week on homework assignments and multiple redos for each quiz, both of which are all or nothing.
Professor Boelkins is amazing and one of the best professors and teachers I have ever had. Yes there is a lot of homework but nothing a person can nor handle and he is always willing to help.
Great Professor, very friendly, makes it easy to understand. However there is a lot of work, but I took Pre-calc so it was always going to be a lot of work!
Professor Boelkins is a living legend. I don't enjoy math as a subject, but I loved coming into his class. The way he provides instruction is crystal clear and he does a great job of helping even those of us who struggle with math at times (me) understand the material. Take Professor Boelkins for whatever classes you can, he is so kind and cares!
if you have the chance to take Prof Boelkins, DO IT! I have never had a professor care so much about the success of his students. He is a great teacher, well organized, and very motivating. There is a heavy workload in his class, but if you stay consistent and utilize his help, it's very doable. Definitely recommend!
Professor Boelkins is an excellent and passionate professor. Everything in the class was wonderfully organized. My only complaint was the amount of homework we got. If that was toned down, it would have been absolutely perfect. Definitely take this class if you get excited about math and/or looking to get a deep understanding of the subject.
Professor Boelkins assigned homework almost every week that took me longer than 8 hours each time. I would get A's in every category except never got higher than a C+ on his exams. He was very picky on answers and would never answer my question when I would ask what he wants. Overall his class is doable but really hard to do well in.
Waaaaaay too much homework. I was drowning. I fell behind a little in class and went to his office hours. He barely had time to see me. When we went through problems and I explained my thinking he asked why I would think something so ridiculous. He put me down even though I was still trying to succeed. Not a nice guy, don't waste the time with him.
Professor Boelkins is my favourite teacher Ive ever had in college. His class is extremely difficult but you will learn so much from his class that you will feel much smarter after each class. His proof portfolios demand a lot of work but Boelkins office hours are easily accessible and you can always email him for help. He responds very quickly.
His class was my favorite college math class. I loved going to class every day.
best professor i've had in college. only thing i dont like is the writing assignments
Professor Boelkins has been the best math professor I've had at Grand Valley thus far. He assigns a heavy amount of homework but it is expected in a math course. He's always willing to help explain ideas clearly and makes himself available if you have further questions. He's very educated on calculus and math in general.
He was a great professor. he does give a lot of homework but he will work with you if you don't clearly understand the topic. he does tend to explain thing in an odd way but allows you to work with other classmates to get a better understanding","Professor B was my favorite professor ever.

227,"Dr. Albrecht is a great professor! He is very passionate about the topics. Even online he finds a way to be engaging and interactive. He has 1-2 hour pre-recorded video lectures each week, a short assignment, and then an easy quiz. Take and reference notes on his lectures and you will do great. Take this class!!
Dr. Albrecht is a great professor. He's very thorough, but his lectures tend to be repetitive. Questions on the quizzes came directly from the lectures. My only complaint was that he did not grade papers until the end of the semester.
He's a really great professor! Some of the lectures are a little long, but it was online so you can speed up the videos if necessary. Quizzes are mostly short answer, but very straightforward and comes from the lectures. Doesn't give much homework; only assignments that are important to learning the material. Recommend taking him if you can!
Really nice guy, super engaged in his lectures. You can tell he is really passionate about the topics, which is cool to see. Quite a few different types of assignments but they were all pretty easy.
Professor Albrecht is a good guy and means well, but he is extremely political and sometimes hard to listen to. I have him for SPM 202 right now and is very left wing bias, so be ready for that if you take him.
Professor Albrecht was one of my favorites. His lecture videos were very easy to listen & engage in. It was my only asynchronous class (out of 4 others) that I never felt I was falling behind & also one of the only classes I have actually learned & retained all of the information. TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!
Dr. Albrecht is one of the best professors I have had Grand Valley. His lectures were amazing and he was engaged in them which is always nice since we didn't have a set meeting time and everything was asynchronous. If you listen to his lectures and take good notes you'll pass this class. Easy A!
Prof. Albrecht has been so amazing. His lectures are always super interesting and he is easy to listen to. He cares about his students and truly does want all of his us all to be as successful as possible. Easy A as long as you do what is asked if you.
Prof. Albrecht is definitely the best prof I've ever had. Most people on here who give him a low score either don't like his yelling or don't agree with the content he presents. He makes it very easy for you to pass his class if you show up and take notes, which are VERY clearly given to you. He repeats himself a LOT which helps with memorization.
Just show up and take notes and you will have no problem getting an A. Only book you actually need is his personal book he wrote. Lecture heavy but interesting topics most time. Terrible at answering questions in class though
I could write a novel about why I don't like this prof. He constantly says how he has tenure so he is ""untouchable."" So disrespectful and rude. Yells the whole class bc he thinks its motivating. Quiz every thursday over notes so you have to be in class to have the notes. Alot of papers and ""learning opportunities."" Just don't take this prof.
I personally did not enjoy this class or this prof. He is very opinionated and very condescending. He teaches his opinion to you rather than actual factual information. The lectures are very boring and he can get side tracked with a story for an entire class period. Class itself is easy but he is very, very boring.
He's a very loud professor but genuinely cares about your success in the class Does have quizzes every week, but if you read and show up to class easy points
Dr. Albrecht is one of the best professors I have had at GV. If you go to class & pay attention then passing the class should be no problem. He gives few assignments, which are easy A's if you complete them, & weekly quizzes. He is passionate about what he teaches which makes it easy to pay attention & learn. I definitely recommend Dr. Albrecht!!
He's a great professor. He's very passionate and enthusiastic about his profession and what he teaches. Show up to class and you'll do great.
He was a great professor. He doesn't give test but you get quizzes and many writing assignments. The books will be needed for some assignments but not many. He is very enthusiastic and made class interesting. Makes you learn and not memorize material. He is helpful and there for students. I would recommend him for future classes as well.
Awesome professor! Super energetic and really gets into his lectures, which keeps you interested in what you're learning. He clarifies the material a lot and there's a quiz every week, but they're super easy so just make sure you pay attention and you should do great. Didn't use the textbooks much but you'll need them for some assignments.
Great professor. Zero complaints
Professor Albrecht is spectacular. He makes lectures very interesting and clarifies things a lot. He is a very reasonable grader as well. No exams except a final- just quizzes which were not difficult. TAKE HIM- you will not regret it.
Best professor ever! Easy class as long as you go and pay attention you see the material a million times and the final is cumulative","Awesome professor!

228,"One of the most arrogant professors that I have met at Grand Valley. He literally laughs at you while asking questions that everyone else in the class has. He is a harsh grader on all assignments and as was said, ""never replicates that level of excellence himself"". He goes over time lecturing for 3 hours straight of pointless lectures. 0/10.
Dr. Farris is the kind of person that only gives out an A for exceptional work but never replicates that level of excellence in his own examples. I was frustrated by how much effort I put in and how little time he seemed to spend looking at my work, just to give a mediocre grade. He often mansplained my own work to me and mixed up students' grades!
Pretty arrogant, always assumes you know nothing about your own project that you've spent the entire semester working on. He really stresses the design process, which is helpful for learning how to take a project from start to finish, but long assignments on that make it hard to actually focus on the project itself, leaving you to cram at the end.
Rare in-class insight is mixed in with an abundance of bashing GVSU executives and other departments. Grading is terribly inconsistent.  While the assignment is explained holistically, be aware that grading will be scored on small details regardless of overall quality.
He is unnecessarily hard and unwilling to help. He writes this off as an attempt to condition his students to the real world. He's generally grouchy and doesn't seem to fit well in the honors program.
He seems arrogant, but really I think it is that he wants you to be your best- always.  He is trying to get you to get all the bad habits of poor engineering worked out of you.  Knows a little about a lot.  I have asked him what he would do with specific engineering challenges, and always seems to have a unique solution.
Rude and full of himself. Quick to put you down if you don't know the answer or understand something right away. Try to avoid taking him...
I had him for lab. He is pretty arrogant and rambles about himself quite a bit but you get used to it. He's very respectable even though he is pretty egotistical. He usually left the class for most of the lab which was kind of annoying when you had questions to ask him but the labs were usually pretty easy. All in all I would recommend him.
Went off on a tangent almost every class period. He would sometimes take an hour talking about something that didn't have anything to do with the class work. Very unclear about expectations.
Very funny and entertaining as a lab professor, but he is a bit unclear with the grading criteria at times.  He also is hard to reach outside of class.  The assignments are pretty demanding, but they all are in the Engineering department.
Alright. Spends most of his time with the upperclassmen classes. Alright. Most students thought the class was hard. Alright. If you read and did the work it was easy. Alright. Online Quizzes suck. Alright. Hes unorganized.
He can explain the material well in lecture, but he's not helpful outside of class. Also he never replies back to e-mails (in case you have questions about anything you learned in class or lab) which is really annoying.
What a jerk.  He's funny in class, but he has no concern for anybody but himself.  He pressures you into doing things you don't want to do.  Laugh it up during lectures, but you'll be pissed when you get your assignments back.
Fun professor, always keeps class fun.  Very energetic.   Knows the material and teaches it well.
A tough grader, but I think I learned the material better than my classmates with other professors.  He is definitely not a boring speaker.
Best Engineering lectures I've had yet.  This man will keep you awake.  Has the best lines too like, ""They should drop a Nuke on the business school"", halarious!  Expects quality work and will not spell every detail out for you.  I'd take him again.
Likes to cuss about volkswagen, and rags on the business school alot plus other universities. He knows his stuff, and is funny i thought he was good
Farris enjoys saying the F-word and is one sexy little guy
The very best lab instructor/lecture teacher you could ever hope for.  Very helpful and considerate. Thinks that engineers are the best thing in the world and will help you in any way to keep you on the right track!  Take him for every class you possibly can!
I think he is great.  I can't wait to get into his class.  He rants and raves on topics cool to every engineer.  What a dude!!!","Pretty arrogant, always assumes you know nothing about your own project that you've spent the entire semester working on.

231,"Prof Lockerd is a nice guy, he cares about how you are doing, and is accessible outside of class. He can be pretty funny too. To succeed you do need to go, he gives random quizzes on the readings, so make sure that you read too. He does understand the amount of work you get in college, so at times he'll remove some things off the schedule.
Professor Lockerd is a fine person, but that's about where it stops. The class is entirely based around his opinions of the plays, and he is not willing to budge on his interpretations, so make sure you agree with everything he says. There's only a few grades in the whole class, and if you want to do well on the exams you have to go to class.
Dr. Lockerd assigns a lot of reading and expects you to read it closely. He calls on people who don't participate. He has a good sense of humor, though his lectures can get a little boring. His tests have passage IDs, so know the reading inside out. He gives solid feedback on papers. Responsive to email. Effort is definitely required for his class.
Lockerd is incredibly knowledgeable and attempts to make lectures funny and engaging. He's sympathetic to students, as he recognizes the amount of work involved in Making of Europe, but he still expects you to do the work and pull your weight. If you put the time in and get to know him, he'll be an invaluable asset.
Lockerd is one of the better choices for Honors professors at GV. He has a great sense of humor and does what he can to make his lectures interesting and engaging. He does recognize the amount of work involved in honors and engineering, but that said, he absolutely expects you to read and study - he has little sympathy for slackers.
He's a very nice guy, but honestly only offers up one interpretation of the plays (religious) and then makes people feel like if they were raised Catholic they're the ""good kids."" Very good about emailing you back, though, and if you email him a copy of your paper beforehand he'll give you comments on it. But I would not take him again.
If you want to spend your time looking at Catholic interpretations of Shakespeare, this class is for you. If you are slightly progressive, I would advise you to look somewhere else. Constant half-funny / off-putting remarks. Besides from that, there is rarely open-minded discussion, but rather Lockerd talking about his favorite lines.
Lockerd is understanding of the heavy course load of engineering students that are also in the honors college at GVSU. He is a really funny guy, but is also intelligent and able to get through course material. He expects you to read, and there is definitely a lot of reading. Also, overall a really cool guy.
Dr. Lockerd is an incredibly knowledgeable individual and perfect for an honors course.  Unfortunately, if you are shy, he can be intimidating because he calls on students randomly.  If you don't participate in class, he may poke fun at you in front of others, which can be embarrassing.  The final exams are also way too long for the time allotted.
 Doing the reading is a MUST as you will occasionally be given pop quizzes. He likes to run his lectures in a discussion format, so it helps to have a couple talking points going in. He responds to enthusiasm and preparation. He sometimes singles out students that haven't done the reading and teases them: if you don't want that to be you, READ!
This is the second time I have taken a class with Professor Lockerd. After having him for Shakespeare, I took Major Authors: T.S. Eliot and learned a ton! His teaching style is very conversational; he really explains everything well and makes it interesting regardless of your knowledge or interest prior to the class. I would definitely recommend!
Lockerd is funny and interesting. He made Shakespeare more interesting for me. Only three papers, with one a research paper based off of paper 1 or 2 (your choice). Midterm and final included. Lots of reading but just knowing the plot points is essential. 
I like this teacher as a person. He is nice, tries to be funny, and is very smart. He tries but his class is boring. He talks all hour to you, instead of making it a discussion with the whole class participating. Basically, just write what he wants you to, and check your grammar well for papers.  He does passage IDs for tests too, so read!
Professor Lockerd is super smart and I enjoyed the subject matter of his lectures. Most of the time he's awkward in a Dad type of way, but occasionally makes insensitive comments and might make a jab at you. The lectures were interesting and he does a great job of explaining things. Be prepared for pop quizzes on reading.
Lockerd is a really nice guy. Very helpful during his office hours while working on papers. Very clear speaker and his knowledge on TS Eliot is remarkable. Tries to keep classes light and interesting.  Pretty tough grader on papers.
My experience with Dr. Lockerd was and continues to be the best I've had with any educator. He's not an idiot-- in fact, he's brilliant-- so he's not going to let you coast through the semester. However, the challenging nature of the course exercises your critical thinking skills and holds you accountable, and isn't that the point of higher ed?
Dr.Lockerd knows what he is talking about. He can be a little old fashioned in his gradings and assignments though (we had to do a final paper and an exam). Be prepared to read a lot and attend rather disorganized classes. But he managed to get my interest and I don't regret taking his class.
He knows this subject inside-out.  Lockerd has high expectations but is always willing to help you.  The lectures were a little dry someone (I took a 6-9), but he is really funny and a great guy.  Take a class with him!
Dr. Lockerd is a very interesting professor and can be quite funny.  However, I found him to be somewhat disorganized in running our civ sequence.  He also frequently gives pop quizzes over the reading while none of the other profs for the sequence do.  I also find him to be intimidating and arrogant.  Overall, he is an okay professor.
TAKE HIM!!!!  He's amazing, and he cares so much.  Will work with you to get the grade you want.  Knows his stuff, funny, and upbeat.  Dad-like.  Great guy!","Lockerd is one of the better choices for Honors professors at GV. He has a great sense of humor and does what he can to make his lectures interesting and engaging. He does recognize the amount of work involved in honors and engineering, but that said, he absolutely expects you to read and study - he has little sympathy for slackers."
234,"Haan, is amazing. She really enjoys teaching, she is very caring, and is willing to lend a hand. Quiz'es everyday class meets! Homework you need to do, and Lab is very easy, just choose wisely! Haan does offer a few extra credit opportunities so take advantage.
Bring this guy back.  Students in his class learn a ton.
I have gotten above a 95% in Spanish 101 and 102. I took this class with Haan and I got a D. I took this class again and received an A. He is rude and gives a ridiculous amount of homework. He is not helpful and makes you learn everything by yourself.The only class I have ever hated going to. DO NOT TAKE HIM.
Most AMAZING teacher I've ever had! Very intense and you have to be prepared to be embarrassed, but you learn SO much in the process. He's hilarious. Lots of extra credit and there is no reason for anyone to get anything less than an A in his class. He hands out the tests the class before based on class participation, no reason to fail a test!
Can be a total softy outside of class... but is purposely really intimidating during class. Mind you, I did get a good grade. But I would probably transfer out of GV before taking him again. The public humiliation was just too much. You will learn because he does know his stuff & you'll be to scared to not know the answer.
A horrible man who truly enjoys catching students off guard, calling them out, or trying to make them seem stupid. Very demanding and demeaning. I will say I learned a lot... but I then I could've also learned a lot from someone else who wasn't so mean. Would never take again. Do yourself a favor and avoid if at all possible.
The worst college experience of my life. Pages upon pages of homework each night - prepare to live and breathe Spanish. Don't take this class unless you don't mind being called stupid and drilled on your Spanish knowledge in front of everyone. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! And DOES look like Clint Eastwood (which is a shame because I like his movies).
Worst prof. I've EVER had. I've seen him make students stand up & mock them in front of the entire class. I do think he cares... because he grades the homework he assigns which is A TON! However, I cannot learn from his teaching style (won't let you take notes). I wouldn't take this class again if GV paid ME... that's how bad it was
He gave more homework than i've ever experienced. the work isnt too dificult and participation and attendance are like 50% of your grade, if you go to class and do your homework you will get a pretty good grade, i went to every class ended with the A and then didnt have to take the final
I learned more from Sr. Haan than I have from any other spanish teacher. He makes fun of students, but its all in good fun and it makes you work hard to know your stuff. Participation is everything, so its not difficult to get a good grade. I would definitely take Sr. Haan again if I could.
He is clint Eastwood!
He doesn't help you track your grade like other profs do. LOTS AND LOTS OF HW! If you take this class with him be prepared to live, eat, and breathe Spanish! I would def NOT take him again. He's also very rude and arrogant.
Lots of work, learned mucho, cheesy jokes but they made me laugh, if you go to class everyday you will get a extra 10% on your final grade.
odd. and looks like clint eastwood.
He is a very hard man. The only reason people put effort forth in this class is because they are scared out of their mind of him. He likes to publicly humiliate his students and will call you stupid to your face. He will mock you constantly and will make you feel like an idiot every time you mess up.
He is a very tough professor.Do not take him if you are looking for an easy A in his class.Assigns a lot of homework, a lot of which is extra credit.Gives practice take home tests every time.Will get in your face and make fun of you in front of everyone.Go to class everyday, no exceptions. pretty fun professor if you're wiling to work hard. OLTRA V
Great professor. If you have no prior Spanish experience, it may be a harder for you. He's repetitive on important vocab, but other than that he covers a chapter per week and doesn't get behind. He gives a lot of extra credit! DON'T take his class if you're overly sensitive - you absolutely need to have a sense of humor. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
I ended up doing really well in his class but I am tell you DO NOT TAKE HIM. He gets a kick out of torturing people and has no conscience. I did learn a ton but it was at a very big expense! Do yourself a favor and do not take him!!!
This guy is great.  You will learn tons if you just put forth an effort.  The best prof to have if you're taking a language.
Spanish classes are taught at a very rapid pace. somewhat unclear about assignments at times but overall an enjoyable prof.","A horrible man who truly enjoys catching students off guard, calling them out, or trying to make them seem stupid.

235,"Currently an instructor at Western Carolina University. He has easily been one of my least favorite teachers I have had. He was never prepared for lectures in the way he should be and doesn't help you prepare for exams at all. Most stressful exams I have taken in any class ever.
I think this guy is rating himself below.  Too many unrealistic comments.
He gave the whole class ""I"" as a grade because we did not complete a project by the end of the semester.  He expected us to complete a 15+ week project in 3 weeks.  We were given no budget, and the scope was forever changing.  ""A hole"" move on his part. He was extremely unorganized in his labs, I swore he was just winging it most days.
Homework was all copyable & graded very loosely. Not very clear in lectures or in lab. Expects a lot of prior knowledge.  If you want to learn the material, try to avoid.
Dr. Jack is the best teacher at GVSU.  He is real life teacher and will be straight with you.  Not realy easy but his classes are the best to take with you to industry
Dr. Jack is one of the only real world professors in Grand Valley Engineering. Always relates work to the real world! Classes are very hard and demanding, but if you want to skate through college go into buisness (this is for all of the cry babies that wrote on this site previous to me) Great prof, hope to have him again!!!
We have Dr. Jack instead of Dr. Sterian for 426, and I couldn't be happier.  With Dr. Jack teaching, I'm going to come out knowing and loving VHDL.  Dr. Jack has been helpful, willing to explain things, and flexible.  He's been a fair grader, and in general, is willing to let us explore the subject apart from the pre-planned path when appropriate.
Demands a lot from every student. The homework load is insane but if you work hard you will get the grade you deserve, and you will learn a lot in the process.
This idiot is the reason many engineers switch to a business major.
Makes labs way longer than they need to be because he wont help you and is not prepared himself.  Assigns enough work for 20 credit hours but you only get 4.  Expects perfection from his students even though his work is shotty.  Avoid him if you can.
I have done so much homework my ears are starting to bleed. The project is wicked.
He is an *SS, He is cocky, arrogant, and leads you in the wrong direction.  his approach to PLC programming is completely one sided (there is more than one way to program)and he loves to make your work that much more complicated. You will hate the smirk!
real hardware, real sparks. Lots and lots of black marks.
Very hard teacher, but he takes care of you if you try to learn.  Labs were Waaaaayyyy to long.  Really makes you think instead of just giving you the answer.
this trash is useless. doesnt help when questions are asked.....
lots of reading and the projects never end
Very difficult teacher...not helpful when asking questions
Could always work at a research university--hillarious",Makes labs way longer than they need to be because he wont help you and is not prepared himself.  Assigns enough work for 20 credit hours but you only get 4.  Expects perfection from his students even though his work is shotty.  Avoid him if you can.
236,"Prof. Pool is one of the most hilarious, caring, genuine, and passionate professors I have ever had the pleasure to be under the instruction of.
Her sunny disposition brightened up our day whenever we saw her. She's taught for over 30 years, and the only thing I didn't like was that she isn't the most present of directors. We'd sing with bad vowels and sloppy diction and it wouldn't be a problem until the day of the concert. We'd get hammered with all the things we needed to correct.
She's the cutest and sweetest woman and is overflowing with passion and musicality. She takes musical expression to a deep level and inspires lots of emotional connection with the repertoire. Always picks pieces with healthy variety.
She picked great songs with good purpose. I loved her attitude about music and she was hilarious as well. I recommend if you like to sing, take choir classes with her because you will have a good time. 
Not a huge fan of her teaching... Came from a really good choir from high school and I'm honestly really annoyed... If you come from with a musical background of a higher level of education, be prepared to be disappointed.
Professor is nice, helpful, and will give you extra assistance in her office at the drop of a hat. Check her office regularly if you want help, because she's often in there outside of office hours working on this and that. Very nice prof.
Professor Pool cares for every single person in her choirs. If you join one of her choirs, she will know you and genuinely care about you. She is a great person.
I really love her! She's the nicest teacher I've ever had, and is so passionate about what she does.
I love her! She is kind and helpful. She will schedule extra rehearsal times just to help you with your part outside of class. She meets with you on regular occasions to check your progress, and the music she picks is always beautiful and interesting.
Very enjoyable class teacher is very passionate. Go to class.
Professor Pool is one of kind. She is definitely a master of her profession. She really knows all there is about music and loves passing on her knowledge, love, and enthusiasm of music to her students. Not one day in her class is dull or boring - she always has an upbeat attitude that makes time fly. You will also learn TONS from Prof. Pool!!
Professor Pool is such a hoot! She loves what she does and wants the choir to succeed as a whole. She loves calling everyone ""good women"" and it is such a joy to see her face when you walk into class. Hopefully, you will have as much fun with her as I did!
Professor Pool is a high-energy, passionate teacher! She demands a high level of musicianship from the group but treats us all as her own children. She is the best choral conductor I've ever had, and you can tell she really loves what she's doing.
Entertaining to watch conduct. Often gets so into the music she hops around. Expect random loud noises when she wants you to emphasize something. Attendance is expected. Don't worry too much about hearings. Challenges your talents as a musician and helps you sight read so much better. Reminds me of an owl for some reason...
Overly enthusiastic, generally clear. Will often get over-excited when conducting and lose the singers/pianist. Not a big fan of sopranos. Well-informed, some trouble communicating, and harsh, but certainly knows her stuff.
Funny lady! A true professional.  Wants you to do well. Is willing to take the time to help students and truly cares about their well being.Very passionate  about what she does but still makes the class fun.Great prof!!
She's a hilarious lady. Unfortunately my grade dropped because attendance is mandatory, after 2 absences your absences/tardies count against you... No good for someone who has class in MAK and only 10 minutes to get to PAC... I highly recommend her for anyone looking for a totally fun singing experience!
Funny lady...when she has caffeine watch out for hysterical comments and excitement! She expects a lot out of her students which is sometimes unbearable, but it makes us better singers. Some of the music she picks out is not fun at all, but the majority of the time she picks out wonderful pieces!
I LOVE PROF POOL!!  She is by far the best prof at GV!  Her enthusiasm makes you want to do your best, and she definitely knows her stuff! She learns everyone's name, and she makes you feel important to the ensemble.  If you're thinking about auditioning...do it.  You won't reget it, I promise! :-)
Professor Pool is an awesome teacher. I love being in her choir. Definately helps me with my singing.","Professor Pool is one of kind. She is definitely a master of her profession.

237,"W PROF
A great Professor, and gives great feedback almost wish there could have been more feedback given from her. I felt as if I was doing great in then class and then practically failed. Also reminder no matter what your process and participation grade is anything below a C on your portfolio you fail the class.
Prof Lafata is awesome! She is very nice & always reminds her students that she is there to help. You have 3 papers that are due at the end of the semester, and a couple small assignments throughout the semester. I 100% recommend this professor!
Professor Kelley-Lafata is the best professor at GVSU, in my opinion. She is extremely helpful and will make sure you pass. I did not open either of the books once and got an A in participation and an A on my portfolio. I also did not attend most of the online classes. I do not recommend doing this, but if youre a good writer, an A is doable.
By far my favorite professor at GVSU. Such a sweet professor who genuinely cares about your success. Her feedback is very helpful and she makes sure you stay on track to pass writing 150, while never overwhelming you or making you feel stupid. She promptly responds to emails. She makes this extremely boring class bearable. Take her.
Professor Lafata is so sweet, she understands you and engages with you one on one very well. I loved having her as a professor because she brightens up your day with her positive easygoing personality and sense of humor.
Kim is one of the most laid back teachers I've ever had. She almost always ended class early, and didn't care if you got up and left halfway through class. Lectures were kinda pointless but that's just because WRT150 is kinda pointless in general. Super sweet and makes every student feel special. Definitely one of the best options for this class!
BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!
She made this boring class fun. She spent a whole hour in class helping me and my friend with our papers. She cares a lot!! She is so nice and so funny, if you get her you will be lucky!!
Kim is awe-inspiring, caring, hilarious, and fun. If you are looking for a WRT 150 teacher that is down to earth, to the point, easy grader, good feedback, relatable and always there for you, then I would take her. 4 papers, no homework, no quizzes, no tests, no final, Possibly the BEST WRT 150 teacher that GVSU offers. TAKE HER.
Kim is literally the best professor I have had so far. The material is so easy and you actually learn some quality things so if you do the work you will pass. But know that this class does not count towards your credit hours.
Kim made me look forward to writing class, even as a BIO major. Her jokes are top notch which really helps lighten the mood in the classroom. She gives you plenty of time to work on your papers and is always willing to meet with you in or out of class. Kim was one of the professors that made my freshman year easier rather than harder.
Prof. Kelley-Lafata might be an angel sent from above. She is one of the most caring ladies I have ever encountered. She is fun, light hearted, always making jokes, gives very helpful suggestions and critiques on papers, she wants her students to do exceptional. She helped me so much I wish every person on the planet could have her as a prof.
Take her!! She's such a great prof that actually made me want to go to class. WRT 150 can be a little stressful because all you're being graded on is the final portfolio but Prof Kelley makes sure to help you the entire semester. The best Prof I've had yet at GV, I highly recommend her.
Best professor ever!!! She was super funny and laid back, always made sure we knew what was going on and required. We never actually got a grade in the class till the end but she always gave you an idea of what you had if you asked her. Gave us like 2 or 3 days off towards the end of the semester. I would definitely recommend her.
She is honestly one of the best professors I have had at GV. She is so kind and funny, and you can talk to her about anything. She provides amazing feedback on drafts and will do whatever she can to make sure you get the grade you want and worked for. I would definitely take her again if I had the chance!
The class is though, but if you get time to talk to Kim she's super helpful. get your papers done and the class will be over pretty early. It's hard to get an A, but it's possible! Wouldn't of wanted any one else as a professor for writing 150
Writing 150 is tough but Kim will make it enjoyable. She rarely gives homework and works with you one-on-one with all of your papers. She is very funny, kind, and helpful. One of my favorite professors so far. I hate writing but I actually liked going to class. You write 4 papers and put 3 in your portfolio. Hands down take her for Writing 150
Professor Kelley-Lafata makes writing fun. She gives you two weeks to write each paper, and helps you through every step of it. She is funny and makes class interesting. There is no reason to not get an A for she is willing to help and revise your paper all the time. I would highly recommend.
Amazing professor who definitely knows what she is doing. Plus, she's funny, down-to-earth, and easy to talk to. She would always offer me help whenever I asked, and I loved how she let you work on your schedule without any extra busy work. I could tell that she really cared about the students' portfolio grades, including mine. Best prof!","She is honestly one of the best professors I have had at GV.

238,"Very nice lady, but extremely disorganized with lectures. When talking about a book, she will be discussing page 30 one minute, then page 2 the next minute, then back to page 14. She claims to be very ""free"" with everything, but yet she wants you to write about what she wants. However, she is helpful and reasonable with grading.
Two words: Pure brilliance! I cannot rave anough about this woman! She is a delight to have for class, she REALLY knows her stuff, VERY down to earth, and really just loves to talk with poeple and get to know them through genuine conversation. I would recommend her to anyone! She really does have quite the passion for what she teaches and it shows!
Her lectures all over the place but if you go to her office she is very helpful and understands things better. Some of the assignments are confusing and not very clear and it seems like there's only a little class participation because she isn't always very encouraging.
I loved professor Chown, she was always helpful and encouraged asking for it. We had a very small class and a lot of one on one time. She taught us a lot about writing, what works and what does not. Very down to earth, open to all writing styles. knows her stuff and I found her to be an easy grader. never felt like i was going to class, take her
She has A LOT of quirks, and I could see why some might be put off. However, I could see the relevance of everything she did and the texts were great choices. Tries to be interactive and allows a lot of freedom in papers. Tough grader but a good prof. Proves you should choose your English classes based on the book list, not always by ratings.
I thought she was a very good professor.  She can be a bit confusing, but she is incredibly knowledgable of the time period and all of the authors.  She also has an almost child-like passion for all of it. I definitely recommend her but be prepared for alot of writing. Also, she's incredibly helpful if you TALK TO HER.
I have no idea what this lady is ever talking about in class. She jumps around way too much and talks very fast and quietly. I always feel lost in class, but my grade is pretty good. I don't think she has any clue what is going on.
Wow.  Where do I begin?  Professor Chown is a very sweet lady, but her lectures are all over the place.  She is not very clear in her expectations, assignments, and lectures.  Asking questions did not help because you would leave more confused and your original question would still not be answered.  I would not recommend this professor to anyone.
She is all over the place.  Don't take from her if you can help it.  I learned nothing.  Horrible.
Yes her class is easy if you are very knowledgable of the puritian era.  She moves quickly thur the text and does not give you enough time to absorb her explanations before she moves on.  Her opinion and thoughts is what she considers correct and refuses to listen or consider others opinion. SHE ALWAYS HAS TO BE RIGHT SHES SUCKS!!!!!
STOP!!!  DON'T DO IT!!! AVOID THIS LADY LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!  YOU WILL RUE THE DAY YOU STEP INTO HER CLASSROOM!!!  SHE IS THE SINGLE WORST PROFESSOR IN THE HISTORY OF UNVERSITY SCHOLARSHIP!!!  RUN!!!  RUN FAR, FAR AWAY WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!  DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!
Ugh. You have to REALLY love the text to survive this class. The class is based out of only 100 points which means their is little room for error. If there is something that doesn't make sense, ASK or else you're screwed. Chown is very knowlegible but often confuses even herself. Attend class, do the ready, participate and ask questions!
Confusing and unclear.  Lectures are scattered.  I often left class confused at what was going on and why.  She seems to be knowledgeable and is passionate about what she is teaching, but ultimately she cannot present it in a clear and understandable manner.
She is extremely scatterbrained and is not open to any other opinions but her own. You must learn how to write to satisfy her, not help further your studies. She can be publicly demeaning to her students. AVOID!!!
She has the knowledge, but she can't share it.  She's scatterbrained, disorganized, and unclear, plus she's very inconsistant.  DO NOT TAKE HER
i agree, her wealth of knowledge is just amazing! she is quite skattered, but definitely worth the experience if you are willing. i suggest meeting with her if you are having difficulties. in my experience, she apperciates honesty and was extremely helpful when i needed it. skattered can be a good thing, just different to deal with.
Dr. Chown's knowledge is amazing. She really knows how to help students learn for themselves. I hope many GVSU students will benefit from her passion and dedication.
Whoever put a smiley face by this professor is completely insane, in my opinion.  I took her for a summer class this past semester, and I thought that she was by far the worst teacher I have ever had.  She is a nice person, but her lack of communication skills, and not staying on track really did it for me.  If you are enrolled, get out now!!!!
I was really excited to take American Lit but sadly she is the worst professor and she ruined the class for me. She is very scattered and she doesn't discuss anything that is revelant to the texts. If you actually want to learn something since you are paying money to take the class, do not take her.
Chown... WOW! She's seriously out there. But essays are easy and you can write about whatever you want. A lot of reading, but you don't always have to do it. If you're looking for a weird but easy class, take her. But if this is something you're passionate about, skip her and take it with someone else.","Confusing and unclear.  Lectures are scattered.

239,"I wasn't exactly a fan of this professor. First and foremost, all that was graded (despite many long homework assignments) was a 12 point midterm and 12 point final. His class was interesting, but the classes were boring and not worth attending because you don't do anything of substance, even if they're mandatory.
Nice guy, but he does assign group projects that don't work great online. Lectures were kind of boring, and there was a lot of work that we had to do that we weren't directly graded on, as our grade came from 2 papers. Easy grader though and definitely willing to help with a paper outside of class. Made us turn our cameras on in Zoom tho :/
He is good, but better if your heart is in it. He is very dedicated to his class.
Jim is a great person and this class opens your mind too much more views and opinions. No one really knows what you are graded on for this class, but if you do the papers and come to class you will be fine. Make sure you speak up in class, it makes it so much better. I enjoyed this class and learned a lot about the topic.
He is very caring about what he teaches, but I found the class to be boring. We spent a lot of time on poetry, and I am not a huge fan of poetry. There was a small section of King Lear. Then we talked about Beowulf and history for basically the rest of the time. He is very nice and gives great feedback though!
This guy could probably trick me into being interested in anything. Obviously very caring and informative. One thing is that he's pretty old fashioned and uses impressionistic grading, so if you need a very clear cut rubric and syllabus this won't work for you.
I love this man. This class was Lit Responses to Death and Dying and he made a class with a sometimes unsettling topic very comfortable. Lots of reading but they were overall short and insightful reads. Very discussion-based. Provides helpful feedback too. Not a bad 6-9. Take him if you can!
Jim is the kindest prof I've had at GV. The class is discussion-based, which made it much easier than I was expecting. Although students mainly direct the class, Jim's lectures were very meaningful and you can feel his passion for poetry. He didn't give much feedback on writing, but he's a very easy grader. I hope I get to take another class of his
Take him for this class. You will not regret it!
Interesting enough class. Sometimes he cuts you off while you are talking or you aren't giving him the answer he is looking for. Other than that he is a very insightful teacher and comments on everything you say/write. Good feedback.
This professor seems like a nice guy and he wants a lot of class discussion to take place as opposed to him just talking at you. He does require a lot of reading and there are projects and papers spread throughout the class. If you take this as a night class, most of the time he will keep you for the full 3 hours. Get ready to be able to talk.
He's a very caring professor. Being that the course I took is literature on death and dying it got quite personal and he's a very understanding person to talk to. He's very respectful and though it's a very discussion heavy class I enjoyed it thoughrouly despite the tough subject. Definitely take his course on the subject. It's worth it.
He's great. Just take him. He cares mostly about getting good discussions going and having a good time with the class. I swear if grades weren't required, he wouldn't make you write anything. It's not a poetry analyzing and writing about it kind of class.  It's largely discussion and he's so so passionate about it that it makes you love him.
I took Professor Persoon as a freshman and I absolutely loved his class. I looked forward to lectures every week. He encourages creativity alongside analytical thought. The projects were interesting and the essays fairly graded. He was always helpful when I had questions, understanding about absences, and overall encouraged class discussion
  dr. jim is a fantastic instructor with a wonderfully deep understanding of the arts. he respects not only students' ideas, but their creativity and emotion responses as well--overall very understanding and kind.
Great class. Always looked forward to attending. Very understanding when a situation (homework, attendance) arose and I had to miss class. Assignments were challenging and open-ended. Could choose topic of personal interest for most essays. Exams were 2-page essays, graded pass/fail. He's intelligent and creative. Knows history extremely well.
This professor was interesting and assigned some really unique writing homework. I like how he encourages people to be creative and not just analytical. He can be very opinionated at times though and he can be really loud. Overall he was good though.
An amazing class overall. Very informative, and at the same time we were still able to do creative assignments and simply enjoy the texts for what they are. I would definitely recommend this instructor.
Very good professor! He really knows his stuff, and he is fair!
He is by far the best prof I've had at GVSU thus far. He is genuinely interested in the lives of the students and strives to make his class applicable to their daily lives. He has strong opinions but also allows and welcomes the expression of opposing views. He teaches by how he feels the class responds than by the syllabus, no tests. just writing.","I took Professor Persoon as a freshman and I absolutely loved his class.

240,"Hes the sweetest guy and knows so so much about natural resources and ecology! Lectures can get a bit boring and sometimes test/quiz questions do not have questions that we learned in class.
Neil is the best and I enjoy his class. You have to show up but the assignments are easy and the exams are more than fair. No stupid group projects either-hallelujah!
Taking NRM 462 with Neil was very fun and intellectually stimulating. Neil is a huge nerd and is very good at teaching the subject. NRM 462 labs were mostly outdoors, featured hands-on activities, and included a few fun field trips. 10/10 would recommend Neil as a prof
Hes not a tough prof on grading or tests like others have stated. He does everything to help his students succeed. You have to make the effort if you dont understand something. Need to go to class and actively listen, take notes, and then actually study for tests. If people think hes a tough prof, then they will struggle for the rest of college
Very boring class. Hard to pay attention. Lectures consist much of pictures he discusses. Exams are fair but you must study hard to get a good grade. Two papers are due during the semester. He grades them rather harshly.
Neil is a huge nerd lol. With that being said, Neil is a great prof, he brought lots of charisma to class, and was effective at answering student questions. No textbook for this class. Although class attendance was not mandatory, I wouldnt recommend missing class often as the lecture portion of this class is lecture-heavy.
Neil is the head of the NRM program so the tests can be hard. You must go to class and pay attention to everything he says for you to do well on his tests. You must study!! He has lots of other grades that will help boost your grade up if you don't do well on his tests. He is a great guy and very helpful when you ask questions.
Neil is a lovely and nice guy. Sometimes he is quiet and his voice can get swallowed up in the big case rooms, but he knows his stuff. His expectations are very clear and there are semi weekly homework assignments that are pretty much done curing class. There is a paper about A Sand County Almanac, but if you're interested in NRM it's not bad.
great teacher truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He is extremely helpful and is willing to work with you. Keeps the class entertained during lecture and is not to tough on grading but still makes you work for it and learn a good amount. 
Neil is a very nice and understanding guy, but he is not the best teacher. He talks very softly and lectures until the very last second. I think this class has awesome material, Neil just didn't do it for me.
Boring, boring, boring. Changed my major because of the amount of interest I lost in the class and field. His notes are not helpful, just a bunch of pictures on slides, making studying for exams incredibly difficult. I got a decent grade in the class but hated every minute of lecture. 
Awesome professor who really cares about his students. Tests are not that difficult as long as you study what he tells you, a few assignments here and there. Has a lot of great connections in the industry so that's a plus. Is more than willing to help if you seek it out. Overall a great guy!
Great prof who truly cares about the future and education of his students. I will continue to seek help from him in my bio/nrm endeavors. He does expect you to work for your grade. Tests can be hard but it is all based on his lectures which are generally interesting.
Neil was really interesting to listen to and made NRM relevant to real life. Tests are mostly essay with some multiple choice and matching. Study hard for an A.
Neil is an awesome guy. I didn't find him difficult at all, but he does expect his students to work for their grades. Just pay attention, study, and put in some effort on the lab assignments and you should do fine. And if you have any trouble, the guy practically lives in his office. Just give his door a knock and he'll be in there.
the lab exercises will make you learn how to do things you may not know how to.  Neil genuinely wants to see students succeed, his office is always open, and he's willing to answer questions and help you understand(I should know, I visited like 10 times this semester :)
Neil is very smart, very organized, and very particular.  However, he's a wonderfully nice guy and seems to enjoy what he's doing.  He's always happy to help and while some of the activities we did in class were a kind of tedious, this was probably the most fun lab I've ever had.  Neil's great!!
Neil is the best prof I have had at GVSU!  He is amazingly organized and an all around great guy.  Workloads for his classes can get heavy at times but you learn a ton.
Neil is great, and he is a hot tamale.  He is very helpful and his classes are quite enjoyable.
a perfectionist. he forgets that he has a phD, and we are students. he is way too anal about everything. answers on exam have to hit a ""target"" or else you get NO points. i think he forgets he teaches a 200 level course, not a graduate course. way too hard to be an undergrad prof. i don't like him",Neil is the head of the NRM program so the tests can be hard.

241,"I hated this capstone class. I quite literally learned nothing, and class was a waste of time. Jelier would have assignments that only allowed for a few pages, and then he would take off random points for ""not including enough detail"". It made me question why I even majored in nonprofit management in the last semester of my senior year.   
A capstone class that is word for word a regurgitation of his PA 307 class. Same power points, same lectures, same videos. I didn't learn anything in this class. Lectures are boring and we spend a lot of time watching videos that should have been used as module material during the weeks we were not in class for lecture. Terrible class setup. 
Rich is a professor that is very one sided and doesn't care about opposing views. He is very profound in himself and is very self centered in his lectures. Seems to think very highly of himself for someone I have never heard of before. Be ready to hear all of his accomplishments every class period
Rich is a nice guy, and that's about where the positives stop.  Presents materials that is literally decades old.  Gave an assignment and made 15 out of 17 people re-do it because they didn't meet his expectations, which are about as clear as mud.  Extremely one-sided, no presentation of opposing opinions.  Take another prof if you can.
Prof. Jelier knows his material.  Be prepared to be forced to contribute, however as with all classes in this format, it becomes normal and constructive.  I am in the GPY program and Jelier should write the text for GPY 309 and 310 as he knows the material better than the GPY profs.  Tough professor, but worth the experience.
Rich is a nice guy, but a pretty awful prof.  Hasn't updated his course material since the mid-90's.  Lectures in questions, interrupts students while they are talking, and has vague expectations for projects/assessments.  Easy to get a B, but nearly impossible to get an A.  Take another prof if you can.
had him last semester, and it is ironic that he talks about building better communities but was unable to build community in his own classroom. He doesn't encourage discussion, he demands it and talks over students anyway. Unrelatable and uncomforable to converse with. Interrogates, but not in a productive ""I want to see you grow"" way.
My favorite professor at Grand Valley and best class I've taken in the PA program so far. I learned so much, its unbelievable. Make sure to do the readings, provide LOTS of specific details in your assignments and participate in class.
absolutely love this class.  learned more more than any other class so far and feel that i became a better, more informed member of society because of it. this class has lead me in the direction of traditional neighborhood design (of which, you study A LOT in this class).  love the class, love jelier!
Extremely difficult, but you learn from real world examples-little theories covered. Most informed/experienced professor in local politics. Intimidating teaching methods b/c he stares at you during lecture and interrogates students ideas. Avoid class if you are not prepared to read all 3 books, attend all classes, dedicate yourself to final paper
I wasn't sure what to think of Jelier at first. He seemed very arrogant and full of himself, but looking back, I learned way more than I originally thought and he really does know his stuff, just don't try to ask him to clarify anything becuase he tends to circle around the question until you don't remember what it was you were originally asking.
this prof takes the time to bridge the gap between intellectual learning and actual civic engagement. he breathed a breath of fresh air into understanding of politics. He is actively involved in the community and because of this encourages you to do this same.
Phenomenol faculty - really cares and challenges you to be an active participant in the learning process.
G'Day Mate!  This class is interesting because you get to work out in the community.  I liked his style, but things seemed to pile on at the end of the semester.  Take good notes and your assignments will be much easier.  Overall, Rich is a good guy and is an interesting professor.
Half of the time I didn't know what this class was about. Jelier isn't interested in student progress, only confusing you more.  Exams are difficult for everyone, even those who read everything.  Class is interesting though, Jelier just doesn't know how to relate to students and picks favorites.
Doesn't care about his students. Very difficult to get in touch with. Hard to figure out what he wants. Picks his favorites early on. Class discussions didn't relate to the course. YUK!!!!!!! NOT a fun class to take! Very unclear and hard to understand what he wants out of you!
Great Class!! I learned so much from him, just do the work and things should go well.
Fairly tough classes, spends too much time dealing with Australia and England.  Definately picks his class favorites from the beginning!
I learned SO much from this guy...yes he is intimidating at first with all that he expects but he is just passionate about public administration!!! if you speak up in class and go into office hours you will be fine!!!
I liked this guy. Just do your work and you will be fine!","Rich is a nice guy, but a pretty awful prof.  Hasn't updated his course material since the mid-90's.

242,"Very knowledgeable teacher who is very enthusiastic about the topics covered. Challenged us to argue her viewpoint if we didn't agree which is nice. Super helpful for the tests and made herself very available if you needed extra help. Enjoyable class
Even if you're interested in the class and really want to know more about politics and international relations, this class could get you lost. She rambled on about her own things and it was impossible to study fully. Study the essays, and you'll do fine on those but everything else I had no clue on how to study to get what she wants. I didn't enjoy
Great class, I really learned a lot. I didn't think that I really liked politics before, but she really got me interested. Some people complained, but it's a pretty easy class if you actually go and study for exams. There's only three exams and she gives you the essays ahead of time (use that to your advantage!). Definitely recommended
great experience learned much
She def. knows what she is talking about. This class does take some work to earn a good grade, but very do able. Attendance is not required but highly recommened. Essay questions in advance, 3 exams, 1 paper, 2 small assingments. Remember def. word for word. Good class, would take her again for another class.
She is actually very impartial regardless of her political beliefs. Don't listen to the angry comment below. The class is very easy to understand, but not incredibly exciting (I don't think PLS is that interesting in general.) I received great grades on all my assignments and the research paper without much effort.
Even if you are interested in the field of PLS, stay away from this class!  I'm going into Admin., so this is a required class, but we're 3 weeks in, and I'm probably going to drop or try my hardest to switch to another teacher.  Quarnstrom forgets it's a 100 level class, not a Master's course!  Very confusing to listen to and tests are ridiculous!
not a good class at all. Really boring and tests were hard. If you dont like writing essays, dont take this class.
She's an amusing woman. The class was not very difficult, contrary to what others might say. She gave the essay questions for the tests in advance, offered lots of opportunities for extra credit and was really enthusiastic about the topics discussed. You have to study the vocab. If you know nothing about politics going in, you'll probably struggle.
Could not stand this woman. Awful class taught by an awful professor. Talks in circles about nothing and is unclear about expectations. Hard grader. Avoid if possible. I hate Glenda Quarnstrom.
she is very helpful and reccommends coming to her office hours, however i think she forgets that it's a 102 class, and no one is half as interested in it as she is, tests are hard, im hoping to get at least a C.. so i wouldnt reccommend
Her mind is indeed a jumbled mess.  She'll get angry if you dont know the answer to a question, and iif you disagree with her on something.  She goes on tangents in class, sometimes about china, other times about something not even related to class, and we don't cover a lot of material that winds up on tests.  Not that great of a professor
She is kind of crazy.  She knows what she's talking about in her head--unfortunately it comes out of her mouth as a jumbled mess.  She skips  around a lot and grades really hard!!
Prof Quarnstrom is insannneeee... shes is never clear about anything, and goes off on tangents in class, so we never even cover some of the info thats on the test... if your in her class.. DROP!
Class is really easy. I went to class, never paid attention, studied what the study guide, pre-wrote the essays and I got an A. Seemed like she thinks everyone in class is dumb, but thats because it was a 102 gen ed class and most students obviously don't want to be there. She's a lot nicer in higher level classes where students express interest.
I really enjoyed this class.  Dr. Quarnstrom is really helpful to the point where she will tell you the exam essay ahead of time and then read them in advance and tell you what to change or add.  Attendance not required but suggested and may effect grade if u never go.  I definitly suggest taking her class!!
Her mind is a jumbled mess. She jumps from topic to topic and gets very mad if your opinions are different than hers.  I remember I went to see her for help on an essay and she told me (two days befor the exam) that she didn't know what she wanted yet and once she reads what other people put she'll decide if she liked what I said or not. She sucks
Dr. Quarnstrom is a very good professor. I highly suggest pre-writing all the essays for the exams she is willing to read them and tell you what to add. This class was not difficult, she likes participation. As far as her politics go, she is pretty moderate in class, not leaning too far one way or the other. I would definitely recommend.
Takes way too long to grade the exams, said they would be done soon and took 2 weeks or more.
She gets annoyed with class for ""not participating"" but never really gives you a chance to answer.  The class is not too tough, just read the book.  Also, she lets you prewrite the essays for her tests.  You can't bring them to the test, however you can take them to her beforehand and she will tell you what you need to add/take out to get the point","She's an amusing woman.

244,"Amazing professor who actually cares about his students. Lectures were entertaining and funny. He's so chill, literally impossible to fail his class. If you like law, take this class. Hes super understandable and willing to work with you. 10/10 would take again!!!
Very, very easy grader. He gave 30% extra to every quiz up to 100%, so you only needed to get 70% to get 100%. He graded papers very generously. You would have to try to not get an A. Despite being very relaxed, he gave very good lectures and I felt like I learned a lot and was challenged to learn, just not in the grade book, which is awesome.
Professor Richards is very calm and he gives interesting lectures. He gives out a several quizzes (all online), there is an oral argument, and two papers. He gives a grace period for all assignments, which is super helpful, he opens a space for students to ask questions and share their opinions, and he cares about his students' views.
I LOVE MARK. He's literally so chill, no exams, no textbooks, and only 2 papers which he basically spells it out for you what you should write. This class was so much fun, great lectures, he has a good sense of humor. Super accessible outside class, he wants you to succeed. 1000% would take again. TAKE HIM!!!
Prof Richards is by far my favorite professor I have taken at GV. I absolutely love him! Very lenient, cares a lot about his students, and is overall super engaging. I have never had a professor respond so quickly to emails and be so understanding of student issues. I learned so much! He makes a class that could be easily boring fun! Take him!!!!!!
I am taking my THIRD class with Dr. Richards, and I am not even a PLS major (just minor). All of his quizzes are open-note/book/internet. He does not do exams. He is so caring--especially with my disability, and a very easy grader. There are only a few PLS professors that are good and he is one of the top professors. TAKE HIM!
AMAZING professor. Take a class with him if you can! He is so understanding and nice. 
I LOVED this professor. His class was easy. His quizzes are easy. There are only 3 papers, but they build off of each other. He was accessible outside of class for any help. He gave me extensions for all my papers due to stress from other classes. TAKE HIM!!!
I LOVED Professor Richards! He was very caring, funny, and overall a really nice guy. The lectures were very interesting and all quiz answers were in them. We had 2 papers and he made the criteria SUPER clear! I would definitely recommend him to anyone :)
super easy prof. makes his courses super easy. easy going and caring. very intelligent prof. he cares about his students. Had him for a bunch of classes As in all of them teaches very interesting.
Great professor and great class with very interesting topics. Grading is easy and he is super understanding. I had a mild panic attack while presenting on Zoom and he gave me so much reassurance and it didnt affect my grade. I would highly recommend for anyone!
I love professor Richards! He made the class super easy and really wants to see his students do well. Because of covid, we had no exams, just weekly quizzes based of the lectures which he records and makes available to you! We had two essays and gave us an outline explaining how to get an A and is super understanding!
I loved Professor Richards, you watch his lecture (only 10-20 minutes each) then take a quiz on it. Everything is open note, open internet. There are a couple of papers but he is very clear on what to do on each section of them. You do two presentations, but all you have to do it present and you get a 100. Highly recommend
He lectured so well and as long as you watched the lectures it was very easy to get an A on the quizzes. The papers are long but he grades pretty easy. This class may have been the easiest class I've taken but it also is the class I learned the most in. He is so goo d at explaining and engaging with students!
Prof Richards is an exceptional instructor. His expectations and grading criteria are crystal clear and it is easy to get an A if you follow his instructions. He is super understanding with extensions. He is kind, funny, and wants you to do well in his class.
This was a great class though a lot of material in 6 weeks. There were numerous assignments, though not super difficult, and a 8 page paper (if you want an A on it) at the end. Assignments could be turned in late, Professor Richards gave a lot of leeway, and he also gave great feedback on all of them. You'll stay busy, but a great class and prof!
Highly recommend him and this class for your gen ed! He was so sweet and understanding about everything imaginable. He made his lectures interesting and provides you with the links necessary to do work-so don't buy the textbooks.
One of the greatest professors I have ever had. Very accessible and understanding of students challenges that may arise. I honestly would come back after graduation to take him again.
Richards is the best prof. Hes super chill and accomodating. He teaches his class in ways that are easy to understand. Very lenient grader. His exams are just like practice quizzes and what he teaches in class, no surprises at all. Ive taken many polisci classes w him and hes the best.
Prof Richardson is a really cool guy, who loves what he teaches, and cares about his students. The class isn't hard, there are 2 big papers, a presentation, a debate, and 3 exams. A lot of quizzes throughout the semester, but they're online with multiple tries, and then all the quiz q's are on the exam as well. Don't buy the textbook","Richards is the best prof.

247,"Professor Estrada was a great professor. His accent might make it a little difficult to understand but not impossible. Hes very passionate about astronomy and adds his own personal experiences with the topics he gives. Hes also always available for extra help if needed. This class is impossible to fail.
Professor Estrada was incompetent at teaching. You cannot understand a word he says and it's so easy to fall asleep in class. His tests have material on them that he never goes over in class. The labs are just an extra two hour lecture that don't help. He also does not use blackboard, so I had no idea what my grades were until after the semester.
This class was a joke. The lab was just another lecture, we didn't do any hands-on activities. He posts homework late on Friday (due Monday) and posted his PowerPoints with all of the important info blacked out. He ignores in-class questions and doesn't explain things well. From what I hear over half the class is failing, this is a 100 level class.
Prof. Estrada is a really nice guy, he tries to crack dry jokes sometimes. However, he has a heavy Columbian accent which makes it kind of tough and boring to focus during lectures. However, he is very intent on teaching his students things that they can put to use in real life, like the night sky and such. Nice guy, just tough to stay awake.
I failed this course and it wasn't for lack of trying. Estrada is a very nice, intelligent guy, but I found his expectations of students to be a little high. We had to memorize all equations, where other profs gave equation sheets or note cards, and we were not allowed to use calculators. Physics is difficult enough without that added pressure.
Pretty average. Talks slow, repeats the same thing in different ways, kinda boring. Labs are mandatory but don't always help you - like watching movies. The tests aren't necessarily hard but it's different than the notes. He is understanding if you miss an exam but keep up and go to class - participation grading happens a lot.
Overall a very good professor, he is understanding if you have to miss class, if  you come to his office hours, but is not very lenient on missing lab. The tests are never really what you think they are going to be, but that doesn't mean they are difficult. Homework is boring, and not helpful, but mandatory. Lecture and lab are both just lecture.
If you go to class and put in the work you WILL do well. His tests often reflect practice problems from lecture so take good notes and go to class. This is a tough class to begin with but Estrada is the perfect prof for it because of his patience. Tests are multiple choice which was a plus in my opinion.
He is very unclear about what he expects from his students, his checklists given to study for the exams do NOT help whatsoever. Participation exercises almost every discussion period. Participation, homework, and lab is what saved my grade. This class was very hard & he did not make it any easier for the students to do well.
Estrada is not very happy about teaching the trig version of this course. He actively avoided us during office hours, allowed some students more time on exams if they skipped other classes, and is very hard to understand. The textbook is even more garbage as it doesn't actually reflect anything from his tests. Exams are brutal.
Professor Estrada was overall a good professor. If you went into his office hours after an exam he would often give you some points back. Exams are anywhere from 10-20 multiple choice questions so if you miss a few you're kinda screwed. One of the kindest old men I've ever met. Kind of awkward and quirky. Would recommend taking him but a hard class
Physics is a tough class no matter who your professor is. Professor Estrada was, I thought, pretty good. This was by far the hardest class I've ever taken but I feel like compared to the other professors, he was one of the better ones. He really does care that his students understand the material and is always willing to help.
The exams are VERY difficult.. I did all the homework honestly without cheating and thoroughly understood everything in lecture and still didn't perform on exams. Symbolic manipulation is EVERYTHING; after 4 exams I still couldn't tell you how to study for them. The exams are all never before seen types of problems that are difficult to solve.
Really awesome professor! Jokes are hilarious, lectures are slower paced--but you leave them with a thorough understanding of the material. His exams are multiple choice and there are no calculators allowed, but they are incredibly fair and not out to trick anyone. Would absolutley take again! 
I thought this class would be easy because I took astronomy in high school but it was somewhat difficult. The tests can be kind of hard because they are over so much material. However, if you go into his office hours he will tell you what you should review. Also, his accent makes him hard to understand at times.
Overall he was a good prof but like others are saying he did have a pretty thick Colombian accent, lectures were kind of long and boring but he was a funny guy and very nice. He never updated blackboard though and he doesn't figure out your grade till the end so the whole class you only know what score you got on tests but never an overall grade. 
He genuinely cares about his students passing. At the end of the year, he told me I was just below the minimum requirement to pass the lab portion of the class and allowed me to have a make-up lab after the final. He speaks quietly, and has a thick Colombian accent, so be prepared for that. Overall, he's one of the best professors I've had so far.
Good sense of humor and an overall likable guy. However, lectures couldn't have been more inefficient and frustrating. If you have good algebra and basic calculus skills, or have any physics experience, you will want to slam your head against the desk while he lectures. An entire hour could be spent on one proof some days.
If you have any aptitude for mathematics or physics, this class will not be difficult. Lectures go at a snail's pace. I did not show up the last month of lecture and still received an A in the course. When he lectures, he confuses more than he helps. Great sense of humor; nice guy  overall. Take Estrada if you already know Physics, not to learn!
He's a funny guy. He's always willing to explain concepts in or out of class and provides both proofs and examples to help all types of learners. His light Columbian accent is easy to understand, and uses a microphone to help amplify his voice. I would recommend him.","Prof. Estrada is a really nice guy, he tries to crack dry jokes sometimes.

248,"I have mixed feelings about this Prof. Very knowledgeable but comes across as arrogant. Weekly quizzes to ensure you show up to class 5 pts. Few points are available which makes one bad exam grade hard to come back from (27.5% each exam, 2 exams). The paper  (22%) was challenging but in a good way. The class average is a C but one exam left. 
He is kind of passive aggressive, and a really tough grader. He can be funny sometimes but other than that I am not a huge fan of him. His powerpoints are also more directed towards him (like a list of what he needs to cover). It's hard to take notes in class, but the textbook is actually helpful. We have one quiz a week, two exams, and a paper.
in this class there is no homework, but a pop quiz once a week to make sure you show up, but they are only 5 questions long. He drops the two lowest quiz score. you have to do surveys throughout the year, the aren't that hard and they are graded by credit no credit. The book is on GVSU save, and personally I didn't use it, but maybe you will. no hw
There are quizzes every week based on what you went over that week. Overall, the class isn't difficult you just have to put the effort in and make sure you're paying attention and following up with the readings.
This class was so interesting, would recommend it to anyone. It definitely helped that Prof Galen was entertaining, funny, and gave really good lectures. take this class. now.
Galen is a fantastic, funny, and intelligent professor. Lectures were fun and interesting and kept me engaged. My only gripe is that there were 5 question pop quizzes typically every week and they are worth a good portion of your grade. There were no other assignments, so there was a lot of pressure to ace the quizzes. Overall, good professor.
He is easy going, responds to emails quickly, weekly test but they're only 5 questions long, super easy class. 10/10 would take it again!
Probably one of the best professors I've had, makes class go fast and they're always really interesting. Easy A, there's one quiz every week that's only 5 points. Makes psychology really easy.
Prof Galen is a pretty cool guy. Hes witty and sarcastic in the best way. He lectures all class, but includes interesting and relevant videos which apply to the material. A 5 question quiz every week is the main thing to worry about. Just do all the assigned reading and actually pay attention in class and youll get a 100
Galen is one of the best professors I've had, lots of dad jokes that keep you engaged. The Content is very easy to understand, I never read the book and did fine. His Exams are word for word from most of his lectures. Its easy, to study for and so much of the quizzes are implied, even if you didn't go to class you can guess and be correct! 
Prof Luke Galen is an amazing professor. He seems like he loves to teach psych. He's amazing with questions so don't feel intimidated! We had quizzes every Thursday but they were related to the material from the recent lecture and they only 5 questions each time so it was super simple. No homework, only quizzes and he's super helpful with info!
Overall, this class was very manageable and interesting. Professor Galen incorporates videos into his lectures and tries to make the content engaging and overall is a super nice guy. There are two exams and weekly quizzes but if you just go to class and take notes on the provided powerpoint you will be completely fine. 
He's funny. Definitely a lecture-heavy class and the quizzes are in person, so it's important to attend. There are 2 exams, a weekly quiz, and a final paper. Tests are worded kind of funny, though, and a lot of the material is easy to mix up. I loved attending class but the testing and paper were a little challenging. Overall a good class, though. 
Galen's class is lecture-heavy, but we watch a lot of videos that help break them up so it's not as bad. His tests are worded a difficultly, so make sure that you study for the exams - you're not graded by a whole lot in this class but he drops your lowest 2 quiz scores. Attendance isn't mandatory but you won't do well if you don't attend.
I have had Dr. Galen for multiple classes and he is a very funny and nice guy. His class and powerpoint structure is very confusing and tests are hard. There are few grades and weekly quizzes. Overall though, he has a lot of knowledge about the field and teaches counseling theories and techniques really well and I learned a lot.
i actually really like him. he makes jokes all through-out class and is very good at lecturing, it's not boring. be prepared for pop quizzes but literally just go to class or get notes from classmates if you miss and you'll be fine. i made the mistake of missing a lot in first semester, don't be like me.
I honestly think his lectures were pretty interesting because it's not just him talking the whole time. He shows a lot of videos that you probably already watched if you took AP Psych in high school but he's a pretty funny guy and makes the content as interesting as it can get. The pop quizzes do suck but just go to class and you're fine.
Pop Quizzes! You will get pop quizzes and you will not know when you are given them. They did not help me in this class because they stressed me out and I wasn't able to know to prepare for them. There are other ways of giving quizzes in order for students to study and prepare for them. This professor made it very hard for me to enjoy this class.
he failed me in this course by literally 5 points, stupid quiz in every class and if you skip it there's no makeup assignments or work for it. he is making this 101 level difficult and ruining students life and time.
Psychology has always been interesting to me but Galen made me enjoy it a little less. He doesn't seem to have a passion for what he's teaching, and all of the lectures are essentially him speaking in a monotone voice for an hour. Weekly quizzes with no prior notice and if you aren't there on quiz day you get 0 points w/ no retakes.","Galen is one of the best professors I've had, lots of dad jokes that keep you engaged.

249,"Prof. Reynolds, is great at going over example problems, aside from that, I can't compliment anything else. He covers material too quickly and doesn't give students enough time to take proper notes. He barely touches on vocabulary and when working through examples, he's all over the place making it very hard to follow. Definitely utilize your book
Prof. Reynolds' lectures were all over the place he'd go from one side of the whiteboard to other and then back to finish a problem and it got confusing as problems grew to be more difficult. Grades nicely and gives credit for having correct processes. NEED to read the book and take notes outside of class, Khan Academy was my best friend.
Professor Reynolds is a caring guy, but I really struggled to understand most of his material. A lot of his lectures involve reviewing problems, but he forgets that a lot of his students need things to be slowed down to understand the material. Physics is a hard class, and he is going to make you work very hard for the grade.
His lectures had little organization to them. I did most of my learning in lab/discussion. His office hours were also very helpful
Extremely disorganized would often forget what he was talking about, and then move on to a different subject or problem. Test are more difficult than they should be, in fact the class average was failing for all 4 of them. I would not take him again.
If you need to take a class to fulfill the physical science w/lab requirement then this is a good choice. Professor Reynolds will get you through the class without much hassle. Math is used moderately but you'll barely be tested on it. Labs are graded on participation. Do not buy a hardcopy of the textbook. It'll be available online with your hw.
Where to start... Dr. Reynolds is an amazing professor. Humble, dry humored, and understanding. The class isn't all that difficult but, the labs and exams are. He's understanding and wants to see all of his students succeed. Please, if you are looking to fufil a pre-rec and see this class available with Dr. Reynolds, TAKE IT! He's a joy!
The class is very tough. Dr. Reynolds is a very understanding prof and will help whenever you need it. His tests are really difficult (avg. class grade between 50 and 60). He is all over the place in lecture and has no presentations to keep him organized. He knows the material so well he often takes shortcuts that don't make sense to students.
Physics is tough. Dr. Reynolds gets that, and is more than willing to help get you through it. Very humble and approachable - learned everyone's names by week two. Top notch professor - highly recommend.
Great professor, very respectful, WANTS YOU TO PASS! Its a hard class but study, do homework, do practice exams, and a B is very attainable.
Very respectable, respects his students, helpful, seems humble which is important because often times other profs egos can impair teaching, good at relating physics to real life, difficult but I loved this class and miss the physics. .
Probably the best professor I've had in my entire life. He truly cares for his students and has a fantastic personality. Forgot to take an online quiz? He'll extend it for you, no questions asked. In a class of 80+, he learned every single student's name. Truly an amazing, helpful, genius of a professor. You do need to work for a good grade though.
Prof. Reynolds does a good job of keeping things interesting in lecture (does lots of demos, makes jokes, etc.) He teaches the material well but the class is just extremely difficult. Exams are very hard and online homework is harder -I rarely knew what I was doing on the latter. I would definitely recommend Prof. Reynolds for this difficult class.
Good prof, hard class, but I never really liked physics, easy tests if you know whats going on, great deominstrations but he does not write alot on the board so if you don't ask questions its alot harder but if you do your fine, he always goes back to explain things
Professor Reynolds is truly a great teacher. He cares about the students and is very helpful. The homework can be challenging and he is notorious for giving very hard exams. But, Reynold's curves the grades according to the class average which is helpful. If you go to class and do the homework, you should have no problem getting a B.
He's one of GV's finest.
Dr. Reynolds is one of the best profs I've had @ gvsu. He is very helpful, make sure you go to office hours. He is a very funny guy and has some good demonstrations.
Professor Reynolds is a good professor. I personally prefer to see more steps for Physics problems presented in class, but he was helpful outside of class. This class takes a lot of work to understand the material, but Reynolds does a descent job! He is a funny guy and has great in-class demonstrations. Do the practice exams and go to office hours!
Really easy class and really good professor. Very lenient on the homework and when its due. The exams were a joke.
Reynolds is an awesome professor. Knows absolutely everything about his subject. His class is fun and entertaining. Moves REALLY fast though. If you keep up with your work, you'll do well. I have never taken Physics before (not even in high school) and I got an A in his class. Would highly reccomend for ANY class.","Prof. Reynolds does a good job of keeping things interesting in lecture (does lots of demos, makes jokes, etc.) He teaches the material well but the class is just extremely difficult.

251,"I really liked taking Professor Scripps. He kept lecture interesting and I could tell he had a genuine interest in his students and wanted them to do the best they possibly could. Final grades aren't out yet, but I got an A or A-. This class is pretty difficult content-wise, so make sure you're keeping up with things and you will be alright!
Dr Jerry Scripps presents in a very interesting and involving way. Adds humor to make sure youre not bored by his lectures. Knowledgeable in the subject area. Sincerely respects students and converts his helping and caring attitude . Open to students suggestions on content, methods
Prof. Scripps is a nice man, and he makes me laugh. His lectures are fine, but his weekly homework assignments in R-Studio are terrible. There's little to no instruction in the later assignments and he does not answer his emails when you have questions. Class went hybrid due to COVID19 and questions on my final project went completely unanswered.
Always helpful and answers any and all questions you may have, you just have to ask.
I took CIS 162 with Scripps, an introductory Java course. He spends the classroom time teaching you about Java with the white board and projector (using a code platform to show real code). He'll answer questions, make jokes, and use metaphors to real world things to help strengthen student understanding of new concepts. Can collaborate on projects.
Scripps is an all round good guy with a great desire to teach. He is very smart and is also quite funny as well. 162 is not a hard class but Scripps made it enjoyable and the subject matter very memorable
My only complaint with Dr. Scripps' web applications course was that his material was somewhat dated. Direct questions about HTML5 or new JavaScript standards fell by the wayside.  That being said, Scripps has an interest in data science, so his thoughts and answers on the internet and web technologies as a whole are very insightful.
Tough class. He seems to struggle to help the students who know nothing about coding, but is willing to do what it takes to help. Lots of projects which he doesn't go much over beforehand, and he expects you to try it on your own first.
This was the most boring lecture and I eventually stopped attending. If you show up for the lab portion and do the online homework on your own, you should get an easy A. This was a very easy class but required a lot of time doing online work. I think Jerry was a very smart prof, but he had a hard time dumbing it down to our level. 
I took Scripps for Comp Sci 162. He certainly knew what he was doing when it came to programming and he usually was able to get the information across. No real tests during the class other than midterm and final. He uses a flipped classroom so be sure to watch the videos before class. Good, not great teacher. Would take him again though.
Scripps has a very unique style of teaching. You watch all of the lectures on YouTube before class as homework and then go over the topics in class. This method helps a lot, because you can code right along with him and can pause and rewind. Any questions can be addressed the next day in class as you go over examples. Very good professor.
Scripps is a bad ass dude. Take this thug for your classes because he's a great teacher. Scripps if life. Scripps is love. Scripps is all.
I went in with a tiny bit of programming experience, and have not found the class to be all that difficult. Scripps was an overall average teacher in my opinion. Very funny though!
Scripps is a great teacher. Some people new to coding might have trouble, but he's very available to help if you're having issues, as is the lab assistant and your classmates. Not too much textbook use, flipped classroom style was extremely helpful. Taking him next semester for 163.
Scripps isn't a easy teacher. He can be funny and is a genius when it comes to coding, but he doesn't really do a good job teaching it to you. he isn't much help in labs at all either. It's hard at first because I had no programming or coding experience. I learned everything just fine, but mostley by myself with my text book. he's a funny guy tho.
The course itself is difficult.  Starts off really easy, but by the end of it you're left confused (unless you already have a background in Visual Basic coding).  Scripps was funny and nice, class was usually pretty entertaining.  The only downside is that when you're in lab, he isn't that helpful.  He just kinda shows you what to do.
This class itself can be difficult especially if you have no prior experience in programming, but all around scripps is a excellent professor. He makes the class fun and he is really laid back.
The class is hard....but I'm not rating the class I'm rating Scripps and HE IS THE MAN!
I had this course a while ago, He is a great guy but expect to work a a lot...I had a little bit of programming experience before and still had some difficulty.  Now, 2 years later, I am good at Java I can see how this class could be a blast.  I didn't really feel like I learned from him until the END of the semester though.
If you've never had prior programming experience, don't expect to understand Scripps' lectures.  Having said that, he is very nice and a fun prof.","Scripps isn't a easy teacher.

255,"Taking his section online was a joke. He never answers your emails when you have questions and posts the lectures two days before they are due. He was a hot mess but he was a kind guy so it was hard to be mad at him. I would not take this class again because of how unorganized he was it just created way more stress than needed. 
Awesome teacher
Prof. Lange is a stellar person, truly cares about what students are doing and wants them to succeed. He often stayed after class for over an hour just to chit chat with students about any random topic which speaks to his caring character. Solid dude, class material can be boring at times but he spices it up with stories and makes everyone laugh. 
Prof. Lange is great. His lectures are always a blast (even if he does get overly political from time to time) and he enjoys interacting with his students, just don't mention you like Busch. Assignments aren't hard, tests are open note. He's just slow to grade and there's not a ton of assignments, but otherwise, highly recommend this guy.  
Professor Lange was a fantastic professor. The problem is that he doesn't release the assignments quickly enough and his email is not the best place to contact him by.
This man is the metal gear rising revengeance equivalent of a professor. An ICON in all senses of the word. This man could keep your leftovers refrigerated because he's just that cool. Man he's so real he doesn't even need a BeReal; he is real. my pronouns in his class is they/them because I'll never be he/him. 

Take this class  
He has been my favorite teacher at Grand Valley so far. His lectures are very straightforward and similar assignments every week are easy if you watch the lectures. His lectures can veer off topic sometimes, but that is what makes him so great. He will talk about his personal life or current events which is always super enjoyable to listen to. 
He uses Pearson My LabIT which is beyond unorganized. You never know what's due. The website also doesn't show you a grade. Lange also has not responded to a single email from me all semester. 
the class was completely online, and I really enjoyed watching his lectures. He goes over material with the lectures but all of the projects and assignments are on pearson. Not too bad of my class overall. You can tell he genuinely cares for his students well being. 
Professor Lange was awesome. The assignments are a breeze, and most of the time he does one of them with you in the lecture. If you don't understand what to do, then you probably didn't watch his lecture. Overall, would recommend him to anyone looking to take this course.
I emailed Professor Lange 5+ times so far this semester and have never gotten a response. He posts his online lectures on Thursday or Friday when the homework is due Saturday or Sunday. His lectures mostly consist of him talking about his personal life, and very little about the class content. Overall, it is an easy class. Pick a diff prof though. 
Lange by far has been the most enjoyable CIS prof I've had at GVSU. He was a bit hard to get ahold of over email, and there were a few unclear due dates provided to students. But whenever I asked him in person for help, he was extremely thoughtful and helpful. Lectures involved real life examples so they could go off topic, but were very engaging
Very unclear about assignments and expectations, and would tell students different things regarding homework and tests (such as when they were due or if we could work together or not) Also, hard to keep on track and goes off on unrelated rants during class - so we didnt learn much.
Prof. Lange is a very nice guy in general and likes to get to know his students. He encourages you to come to the lectures but they are not really important to the class. The labs are helpful though. The class basically covers all the different Microsoft Office programs, so was pretty helpful in that aspect.
Pretty easy and straight forward class if you know anything about Microsoft word, excel, etc.. But really only talks about his personal life during class, I love to get to know my teachers but its everyday. Also gets REALLY upset if you miss a class, I'm sorry Prof. were in a pandemic if I'm not feeling good I'm not coming to class.
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Dr Lange is a terrible professor. He does not help his students at all. Doesn't respond to emails either. Avoid at all costs
David Lange for CIS 150 is one of the best professors I've had at GV. His class is very simple but you will have to put the time into it. The only down part about this professor is that he is bad at answering emails. If you are trying to get his attention, stay after class to talk to him or set up an appointment with him. Overall, GREAT PROFESSOR!!
Hands down one of the most frustrating classes I've ever taken. He NEVER answers emails, doesn't explain our homework, and his lectures are long and confusing. The content of the class is fairly easy, but Professor Lange's teaching technique makes it 10 x harder. Do not take this class, you will regret it. He is a nice person, not a good professor.
This is the poorest excuse for a capstone class ever. What kind of prof never replies to his school email, but then emails his students 2 minutes after class starts that it's cancelled? And constantly leaves his students wondering what the plan is for the next class session by waiting for an email an hour or less before class for the details? Wow.
He is one of the funniest prof's I have had at GVSU which makes class ten times more enjoyable to go to. He's also pretty understanding about late work and extends deadlines when he feels needed. He responds back to emails pretty quickly and makes the lectures fun when the content seems boring.","Prof. Lange is great.

257,"Great Professor!!
Dr. G is the best! Take him if you have the opportunity to. His lecturing style is easy to follow and I thought that the workload was fair. He is very nice and helpful if you are struggling to understand something and go to his office hours. 
For starters he wrote his own textbook which is poorly written. You don't NEED to read the textbook or really anything to do okay. He teaches you everything you need to know in lecture. His homework is harder than his exams which is good. He talks very fast in his classes. Overall good class and good Professor if you can keep up with him.
Learning maths can be boring, but meeting a good lecturer can turn everything into gold. Gabrosek is one such person. If given the chance, I will choose his lectures. Although sometimes he is a little clumsy, but his heart to make us fall in love with mathematics is enough to make him deep impression in my heart. Best wishes!

Dr. G is so kind and makes stats engaging. He breaks it down so it is simple to understand and he goes out of his way to help students and make sure they understand the material.
I really liked Dr.G! He made 321, which was online this semester, still a very interesting class. You can tell he really cares for his students and wants them to succeed. He gives a fair amount of homework and is always willing to give extra help. If you have the chance to have him as a prof definitely take him!
Dr. G is a nice guy, he would always answer questions if you had any. We were required to use a coding system in this class, and idk what other stats class requires that. You have 6 HWs and 2 tests and a final. Class material was boring but not too difficult if you paid attention. I didn't really read the book, only used it to get hw questions.
DON'T! The guy wrote the book, first red flag. This is the one of the only Stats classes at GVSU where you have to code. This class was made to be way harder than it should have been. Just take another prof. He's a very nice guy, started out the class with a fun little chat question to lighten the mood but the tests and HW were so hard and FREQUENT
He requires his students to use a textbook he wrote and it is not very well done. The problems are very hard to understand. He also requires you to teach the lesson to yourself before class and then take a quiz, which destroyed grades because the textbook was hard to understand. He took an easy class with easy concepts and made it complicated.
Honestly, the class material is not that hard, but the information all has to be taught to yourself. Professor is nice, but he uses a team based class, which means you need and rely on the other members of your group, who are assigned. His grading is also weird and not ideal, but it's hard to explain.
I LOVED Dr. G!! This is a team based learning class, so be sure you work well in groups. A lot of the material you have to teach yourself, but he also goes over the important topics in class and has really good points to make. He gets to know every single student in his class and you can tell that he wants every student to succeed.
I really liked this professor! He knows what he's talking about, and he literally wrote the book that we use. He is super nice and helpful, and never looks at you like you asked a stupid question! Just make sure you attend class - he knows when you miss.
Gabrosek uses a team based learning to teach his classes. So the entire semester you are working with the same group. He wrote his textbook himself so it is sometimes hard to follow and he requires it to be read. He makes you take quizzes over the material before he even teaches it, requiring you to teach the concepts to yourself.
Professor Gabrosek overall is a pretty good teacher. He brings great energy and enthusiasm to the course. However, he doesn't lecture a lot, and that's tough for learning statistics. I felt like I had to teach myself a lot of the material.
He's okay. The Team Based Learning really wasn't my thing and everything you learn is on your own through the textbook. Then you just work on activities with your group and he may go into little detail about some questions explaining how to do them. He's really nice just learning style wasn't for me.
He's probably a better professor to take for stats, but I wasn't a huge fan of his teaching. If you enjoy team-based learning then he's good for you, but I was not a big fan. He wrote the textbook for the class, but it can be tricky to comprehend. A very nice guy but I did not care for his teaching (or the subject itself).
Dr. G is one of the best Stats prof out there. He allows a cheat sheet on each exam, and you can put anything you want, even examples. He makes what is going to be on the exams very clear. The hw, is easy points to gain. He is a funny corky guy and remembers his students, and generally cares about his students. 10/10 would recommend
Best professor for Stats at GVSU hands down. All my friends that took stats almost failed because their professors were so bad, but Gabrosek made the class understandable. He uses team-based learning which I thought I was going to hate but I had an amazing group! Everyone loves him and he is very personable. If you're taking stats TAKE HIM
After taking my last statistics class I was really debating dropping my stats minor. Prof Gabrosek is what kept me going with my minor. His lectures are clear and he is more than willing to answer questions during and outside of class. Would definitely recommend!","I LOVED Dr. G!!

259,"The course consists of 3 exams 2 activity sets and a final paper. She doesn't put the activity sets in until the last 3 weeks of the course so you have no idea what your real grade is. Her exams are not based off of material taught and are written to confuse you. Take a different professor for this course. 
Was a very sweet lady but I didn't enjoy her classes. Spoke very fast, often had to ask if students were following along,then proceeded to teach before anyone could answer. Her assignment answers are often different than what she taught in class,she is also absent often. She was also impatient at times, almost like she wanted to rush through class.
Dr. Nochera is the best BMS capstone prof-- no question. She gives you so much time to work on your paper (which is the only thing you do all semester), you barely meet for class, and she is an easy grader on the paper and presentations. Very easy A with her, and she is an absolute gem of a person.
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Her lectures are horrible- she talks so fast that you can't even understand what she's saying and more than half the time she has no clue what she is talking about. She makes slideshows for you to take notes but it is pointless because none of it is ever on the exam- the exams are just based on her personal opinion
Her tests were on lockdown browser and not based on anything she taught. She made up the questions and answers based on her opinion. Also made us write a 3 page paper for our final exam and never graded it
Exams are the worst. Typos in every question, most questions are confusing and trick you, she curves every exam by at least 10% because everyone would do so poorly on them. I mean she will make sure you get a good grade however, it was a struggle all semester trying to figure out her exams.
Literally take any other professor for this BMS class, the exams are nothing like the topics covered in class and she says that she cares but upon asking her a question she acts like you've just offended her and that you're stupid. Don't bother emailing her outside of class either, she's no help and will not accommodate for anything.  
Ive been in this class for a few weeks and this is probably the worst class Ive ever been in. Shes awful at lecturing and talks so fast. She tells us to ask questions and then gets very rude when we ask to clarify something she says which happens all the time because she talks ridiculously fast. DO NOT TAKE HER. exams are nothing like the notes
Didnt even grade our final paper this past year , just collected it and submitted our final grades without it even though we worked on them for a whole month. Lecture material is rarely whats on the test, you practically have to memorize the whole book. Doesnt matter if you were sick (quarantined) and did an assignment, no credit if not present.
Awful prof. Lecture content was outdated and questionable. Terrible at lecturing, would talk super fast and pretty much just read off vague bullet points and never explained anything. Would email her with specific questions and she would give me two word responses that didn't even answer any of my questions. Overall very unhelpful and wouldn't take
Most confusing and unhelpful prof ever. Wasn't even able to answer most student questions because she would get confused and not understand what you were asking. Kind of demeaning and lectures were rushed with almost no info given. Exams had specific questions on them them that she rushed through in class and weren't in the book. Don't take her.
Professor Nochera is super caring towards her students, and is always emphasizing that she wants us to succeed. She moved her exams to an online format so that we could use our notes and she gave us all 100% on a few quizzes. The only thing is that her lectures seem to have little connection to the exams, but it makes it easier with the book.
She expresses that she wants us to succeed but teaches nothing that is on the exams. We have online exams mostly and I even looked at my notes from her lectures and 90% of the information on the exam was never taught. Do not take her class!
professor nochera is such a nice person, she genuinely wants everyone to do well. the course itself will be HARD if you don't read your book. every class is lectures and notes, but the majority of info on the tests are from the book, not what we cover in class. but we always get out like 30 minutes early which is nice!
Do not take this professor. Her entire class revolves around lecture videos that do not relate to the exams at all. Her lectures have very little useful and accurate information so you're basically wasting your money taking this class because you learn nothing. Her emails also make no sense and she makes you feel stupid for asking questions.
She's absolutely sucks. I am generally a good student who gets all As but she made it nearly impossible. I swear I only did decent on some exams out of pure luck. 10/10 do not take her.
Dr. Nochera is not a very good professor. Her online lecture videos were nothing like the exams at all. Her lectures are just her rambling and she is not very good at explaining. There is barely any work to be graded, so if you don't do good on the exams you're basically screwed.
Prof. Nochera's instructions for everything were incredibly unclear. She doesn't really know how to run a class. The exams covered no material that was learned in class and when you'd email her about it she'd have a lackluster response that never answered your questions. I would not recommend taking her ever.
Extremely confusing professor. Her emails make absolutely no sense. This class was online & all she posted were 3 short lectures covering weeks of material? They don't prepare you for the exam whatsoever. The exams were so difficult for no reason. I didn't learn a single thing & am still confused. I have taken nutrition before & I was still so lost
I have never had a more confusing professor ever. She will say one thing but mean the total opposite. This class you will not learn anything, its more about passing and getting your work done before exams than learning anything. The work was easy and came along with pre recorded lectures. Questions on the exams would be worded very confusingly.","Awful prof. Lecture content was outdated and questionable.

260,"very helpful during labs and always ready to answer questions, good explanations at the beginning of lab, would definitely recommend
Dr. H is a fantastic prof! She is very caring and cares about her students succeeding. She extended many assignments this semester to give her students an opportunity to succeed. You definitely need to put in effort to succeed, I mean it is a chem class!! I would highly recommend her.
Dr. Henderleiter is so understanding and kind. The content is hard, but she is always willing to help if you reach out. I would email her and get a response pretty quickly with a long response, making sure I understood everything. She posts modules with lecture videos and some assignments, and those along with the quiz/test are due weekly.
I loved Julie!! She really cares about students so much, and as long as you put in the effort for chemistry, she will help you succeed in this class. I will genuinely miss her because she was so nice and motivational for me to do well in chemistry.
Dr. H is very boring but is helpful when you ask. The exams are nothing like the review and she puts things that you never learned on it. She is a very unfair grader and gives the people who are lazy more chances to bring their grade up and the good students just get what they get. I would highly suggest avoiding her as a teacher.
The homework and tests don't match the notes which makes this class extremely hard. Her lectures are kinda pointless because she'll bring stuff up that won't ever be used. The homework and tests have things on them that were never discussed and she expects you to know how to do them even when you weren't taught
Super nice person but she doesn't teach the material very well. Having a hard time doing the homework due to her not teaching the material. Very confusing and hard to follow
While she is the only chemistry teacher I have studied under, Dr. Henderleiter is an incredible professor. In a lecture hall of 80 students, it's obvious she cared about each of us. She is incredibly concise in her teaching so you know exactly what to expect on exams and homework.
Shes a nice person but her lectures are very boring and kind of hard to follow along. Her examples she gives and whats on tests and quizzes dont match up. If you dont already have a good basic understanding of chem and the math thats used, then take someone else.
She is strict but fair. Kinda boring.
Dr. H is an angel. She sincerely wants everyone to understand. Lectures are often engaging, her sense of humor is impeccable. Inorgo-chem is a HARD subject, but she goes above + beyond to make it accessible to everyone. Spend time with your assigned group outside of class to do the homework problems, and pay attention to example problems.
She is a nice person, but always seems so confused by the material. It got to the point where other students in the class were correcting her multiple times per class.
Chem 115 is a course that you will have to work at. Even if you come from an excellent science school, you will have a wake up call. With that said, Mrs. Henderleiter tries to place students in groups that will help you achieve the best results. If a student wants to do well, they will do well.
Prof. Henderleiter is a very enthusiastic teacher and she shows you that she cares about you and your grades. She definitely makes you work for your grades and her tests are fairly difficult. I am a mostly A student so ending this class with a B- was quite a let down. I could have probably tried harder though.
If you ask her questions her answers are very vague. Her grading criteria is also very unclear, especially in lab. She is a very nice person but not a very good professor. Don't buy the textbook; you'll never use it. If you forget to do online WebAssign homework your grade is gonna hurt. Her tests are ridiculously hard. Get a tutor from day 1.
Dr. Henderleiter was helpful at times, but her grading criteria for lab reports was extremely fuzzy. It was the lowest grade I received this semester. Don't take it at 8am; it sucks.
This class was WAY too difficult for an intro class. I came into this class having never taken a chem class before, and she demands that you have prior knowledge from high school. Passing this class is fairly easy if you have experience with chem, however if you are not great at chem, expect to struggle. Her tests are extremely hard. 
I really enjoyed taking this class. Im interested in chemistry though but even with an 8am downtown I enjoyed going. She doesnt check attendance but its always good to go. Best thing to do is work on problems and the class will be a breeze. I would definitely take a class with her again!
Prof. Henderleiter is a very good teacher, she wants to make sure you know the material and use critical thinking skills.  That being said her tests can be difficult but if you study hard you can do well.
She isn't the best at explaining the material, but she is very willing to answer questions.","Shes a nice person but her lectures are very boring and kind of hard to follow along.

262,"great prof
Couldn't stand him, but he was super easy. Study 3-5 cribs before every quiz and you'll do fine. Did other homework through every class and still pulled off an A. No homework besides 1 paper so you have no excuse to not study. Super boring and he didn't like me for being late to class 1 day though.
Study the cribs. You're good to go.    ONE MINUTE, ONE MINUTE REMAINING.
Professor knows subject well.  If you find cribs and study from them, you will do fine in the class.
ONE MINUTE.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE REMAINING.
CRIB!!! Study crib and section for 30 mins prior to class and you'll get a good grade.
Very easy class. There's a test every Wednesday, but if you study the cribs, you should be in the clear. Attendance isn't mandatory, but when he goes over the material, he adds useful information in that's not in the class manual. But overall, very easy class, and Riffe is a knowledgable guy and has lots of stories.
Riffe is extremely easy. All you gotta do is come to class and study his cribs and you will pass. He takes attendance by passing back the quizzes and whose ever he gets back, they're marked absent. You take the quizzes on the day he doesn't pass quizzes back so attendance is mandatory. He is boring, but he is the best IME 100 professor to have.
Do not take the 8am class. You will not be able to stay awake. His tests are very cribable, so just study the night before and you should be fine.
Easy class, nice prof. Tries to keep a boring class interesting and is a pretty funny guy.
Amazing guy. Great lab teacher. Very helpful if you go talk to him during office hours. Really nice if he likes u. BUT, the MOST BORING LECTURE CLASS EVER!!!! Take a pillow or a computer!! If you even have a trace amount of intelligence, USE CRIBS!!!!!
He's a nice guy and wants you to do well, but if you are a CE or EE student, lecture will bore you to death.  USE CRIBS and you'll get an easy wag booster.
He's a great man. He tells you to use cribs to help you study, so do it.
Memorize the meaning of the words for the quizes and you will ace the class. If you don't understand something look it up online and you will do fine.
his notes have terrible pictures and don't always explain properly, look everything up online and understand it that way, combine with cribs and you will ace this class easily.
His quizzes are badly written, tries to trick you. Pay attention in class, I have used this material at work more than any other class.
1 minute, 1 minute remaining!  Not a bad prof.  Lots of memorization for quizzes.  Got a good grade.
Not a bad grader, much easier than most any other prof. teaching IME 100, a little long winded but otherwise a good prof.
Very easy professor. Explains things well, and cares about student performance. Study before tests and quizes, and you'll do fine.
Easy Class","Riffe is extremely easy. All you gotta do is come to class and study his cribs and you will pass.

264,"Hard at first, but getting to know him more he is a great professor. Makes you work for the grade you deserve. He is a hilarious man, who is also genuine if you don't understand. I would recommend you take him, he is someone who genuinely loves chemistry.
If you want to pass, you need the book. Even if you just have the older edition- I actually recommend the pdf, because then you can also use the periodic table when necessary for the course. I had him for 135 (lecture) and 136 (lab) and deff hope you have him for lab. Get on his good side, you'll get an A. 
Awful. Everyday it felt as if ""Doc Mac"" hated the class. Occasionally he had his moments of comedy, which were forced and distracting. Tests never felt fair, as the material taught to us in class was not what we would find in the tests. Textbook is mandatory to actually succeed in class as that as where the tests come from. Go for an older edition.
Had a hard time with the out of class work because i had bell for chem 135. Slightly funny. Make sure if you get him for chem lab, get him for chem 135 also. Hmwk after every lab but isn't bad if you know chemistry. Tests are kinda easy.
Had him for 136 and 146 (both labs) and got an A in both. Really helpful, even if he does talk down to you (I think he's just trying to be funny though). Not cribable so look over labs before class to prepare for quizzes. Bumped up my grade at the end of the term for being friendly with him and good attendance. One of my favorite teachers at KU.
Good prof, not a bad class if u keep up on hw, and he is really funny
Wouldn't have gotten above a C if I hadn't had Chem in HS. Tests are hard but he's not a bad prof. He follows the lab schedule in his lectures which helped - my partner had Bell who didn't follow lab schedule at all and put them at a disadvantage.
It's a tough class. Good teacher, shows mastery of subject and good teaching skills, just he will make you work for a good grade. You can pass by doing a little bit. But to get an A, you'll have to go above and beyond what you'd expect from other profs at KU. Funny guy, and class was always interesting. It's just a tough class.
Doc Mac acts as if he does not care about the students or the class. He does. He is a decent teacher, but his tests are moderately cribbable and come straight from the example problems he does in class and the homework. Not much partial credit so you have to know your stuff. Go to class (for examples), do your homework and studt. He's not THAT bad.
He is a very rude professor and expects you to already know the material instead of teaching it properly. His exams are hard and you need to do a lot of independent book studying to pass. If you can avoid taking him then do so!
The professor expected the two-person groups in the chemistry lab to work independently.  However, he would be there whenever anyone had a question.  Furthermore, I can tell that the professor cared alot about his students.
One of the few educators I have encountered that I sincerely and passionately dislike. 'Doc Mac' made CHEM-135 a miserable, if not intolerable, experience. He is somewhat disrespectful to students; he arrives late to every class and answers questions unwillingly. He lacks enthusiasm and seems disinterested in the subject manner as well.
For Chem-Lab, Doc Mac is a good professor to get, he shows you how to do all of the labs and the practical is very easy thanks to him. If you get him for chem-lab, don't worry.
He can seem to be a nice guy at times, but for the most part is really rather rude. He is not very good at explaining things, and gets angry when you ask him a question. Avoid his class if you can.
Difficult material and he wasn't much help.  Lab was really rough- no one ever knew what was going on.  He's too vague about what he wants.  He's looking for something specific, but he won't tell you what it is.  Don't take him if you don't like essay tests.
Doc Mac seems like a ""nice guy"", but his tests are WAY too hard.  I put a LOT more time and effort into this cl**** than any of my other cl****es this term, and this cl**** was by far my worst grade.  Other cl****es were senior level engineering cl****es, so they should have been at least as hard/harder
He is the most useless prof. for the chem lab at Kettering. Unwilling to help and does not care about any students what so ever. Do not take this professor is possible. Only reason I got a decent grade was because I knew the material before hand.
he was ok, quizes were hard and the class took forever.  Other classes would leave and we would still  have an hour of work ahead of us because he talks  so much in the beginning of class.  Was somewhat mean if you asked a question but overall he wasnt THAT bad.
Doc Mac refused to give partial credit on test questions that he, as the professor, worded incorrectly. He is very vague at explaining things and doesn't like to have students correct him or question his lectures. Tests are fairly difficult and very specific on a subject that has no bearing on engineering and is a pre-req for nothing.
Very difficult class. Partial credit was next to nothing. Also an intimidating person to talk to. If you have to ask questions, talk to him during office hours. That makes it a little easier. Only needed 650/1000 to pass the course which was nice. Plenty of opportunities to get the points needed.",He is a very rude professor and expects you to already know the material instead of teaching it properly. His exams are hard and you need to do a lot of independent book studying to pass. If you can avoid taking him then do so!
265,"@KETTERING - WHY is this professor still teaching? What a shame that this is what the University thinks a QUALITY professor is.
His way or the highway when it comes to techniques so if you found a good way to do something too bad.
Class is moderately difficult and Salacuse just doesnt give coherent lectures. Quizzes are straight from homework but he doesnt want you to use methods found from homework. Drops lowest 2 quizzes which you will desperately need. And exams are cobbled from homework and quizzes. Dont take
Barely did any examples in class. All quizzes were exactly from the assigned book problems. Pretty much left you to learn diffeq yourself without much help. Did not write much on the board and ended class way too early to learn anything most days. I learned almost everything in that class solely from going to SI.
Do the homework. Quizzes based on homework. Tests generally cover homework questions. Drops 2 lowest quiz grades. Take him if at all possible, since your other option is Dimitrov and chances are if you are taking this course, then you need to actually learn the material. You will not learn anything from Dimitrov. Take Salacuse.
Prof. Salacuse knows his subject and lectures well. He gives 6 quizzes throughout the term and will drop the lowest 2. His quizzes come straight from homework and tests are usually modified homework questions. Do the homework, get 100% on 4 quizzes, and study quizzes/homework in preparation for the tests. Easy A.
Great professor. The only reason I failed his class is because I'm stupid. He has 6 quizzes, which contain problems straight from the homework. I didn't do my homework, so I didn't do well. However, he drops the lowest two quizzes. You will also have to memorize three proofs of calculus theorems. It's not as bad as you think.
GMI Joe solves differential equations harder than me and lifts weights harder than me! Overall a great class. Learned a lot.
His lectures may not be the most exciting things in the world, but he explains things fairly well and will treat you as fair as possible.  He has always been consistent; he has 6 quizzes, of which you get to drop two and all of the questions come from the homework.  He will also give out a midterm and a final, which have different questions.
Excellent professor, highly recommended. Do the homework and you've already done your quizzes and exams, just go over your homework the night before and you've pretty much got it. Knows what he is talking about, extremely helpful, best math professor I've had.
Do the homework and it's an easy A. Quizzes are straight from the homework. He drops the lowest two quizzes. Have to study for the midterm and final - his old exams on eReserves are helpful and make the exams easy. Have a group Maple project due at the end of the term but he is very helpful and even came in on weekends to help.
Mastery of subject,good teaching skills,generally nice guy,but damn it that class was hard. 5to7 nights of studying each week,and even studying the material after the test I just took on that material to better grasp the material.He's a great teacher,just the material didn't click in my head as easy as I'm used to.Didn't do Laplace much at the end.
Pretty good prof. Just take notes and do homework assigned. there are 6 quizzes based off the homework and he drops the lowest 2. Pretty fair grader. Can be sorta random in lecture but alright otherwise. Would take again without issue.
Great Prof - Quizzes are right from H/W. Mid term and Final were tough, study hard and truly understand the material. Good guy, fun class.
Quizzes are cribbable and easy.  Do the homework and you'll get 100.  Tests aren't too bad if you do homework and review quizzes.  REALLY boring lectures.
Good guy, easy do the homework the night before the quiz and you will do fine.
Prof salacuse was a great prof.  I learned all of the material.  I got a high grade plus learned it.  If you don't do the homework take a different prof.  The homework isn't graded or looked at, but u'll fail if you don't do it.  I'd take him again.  If you study you get good grades.
Gives a lot of time in class to answer questions from the homework. Drops the lowest two quizzes, so you have a chance to mess up but not take a hit from it. Teaches well, but a really hard grader. His somewhat low, monotone voice could lull one to sleep if they're bored. (Catchphrase: ""Is everyone with me who wants to be with me?"")
Good teacher, explains things very well. Do the homework and you'll do well in the class.
Good Teacher, teaches the material repeatedly so you understand it. Quizzes are just like the hw, so DO THE HW and you'll do fine. Midterm he's throws you off a little, but study and pay attention and you will do fine. Visit his office hours, and work early on the maple project!! Good prof!. Dressing style rocks! Def bring bubbles to class :)","His lectures may not be the most exciting things in the world, but he explains things fairly well and will treat you as fair as possible.

269,"As a freshman I reluctantly went to his office as I was desperately failing. He had every reason to not care, because it was apparent I didn't care enough. But he did challenge me, and patiently worked with me. Pulled a B in HS-102, and because of him I changed my minor to history. I loved that man.
I had Dr. Cole as a prof. and and my college advisor during his time at McKendree College in Lebanon, IL.  He was still completing his PhD at St. Louis U. at the time.  Dr. Cole was tough but extremely helpful and understanding.  I majored in history and thorougly enjoyed all the classes I had with him.  Tough ..... but he really prepared me .
A big-league professor. Cornerstone didn't deserve him. He is actually worth the price of tuition.
Best professor I had at Cornerstone. I actually felt like I was getting my money's worth.
he's the man, my favorite prof as of yet. dry sense of humor, but it cracks me up. he may seem hard, but he's hard on everyone equally, we miss you dr. cole, come back!
he sucks. he wanted to fail me...but knew better than that...glad he's gone
He knows his subject matter and is helpful, if you go and ask.  He has a really dry sense of humor, but it's not bad.  Any class is not an easy A, but well worth the time and effort.
hard... im not a big fan of people who intimidate me... probably because not many can get away with it... but he's genuinely intimidating.. and not necessarily in a bad way... but lets be honest, i never did my reading, i listend in class... most of the time, and i fell behind on my worksheets = D+
he's smokin hot
This man is not ****.  He is the most hopeless romantic that I know. He is genuine. His humor can be brash, but I think that he sees it as constructive criticism.  He cares, and he is fair-He's hard on everybody.
He is tough on every student.  I have seen him tear apart both male and female, but he does prepare you for college.For you all who still attend a small school when you get out in the real world people wont always be there to give you a hand. Its life
He's tough and not all warm and fuzzy, but I don't think that makes him a bad prof.  It's just his personality, and he wants us to do well...he's just not willing to nurse us through every bad grade.  If you try to get to know him, though, he's nice.
He is hard but what you take away personally as well as academically is well worth it.  You learn so much about yourself and how you study and what will make you excell as a student
Dr. Cole is very hard, but he is also very knowledgable and willing to help.  He takes an interest in each student and does his best to help them learn.
I disagree with the statement that people who rate this prof badly are those who don't study and want an easy A...I am the farthest from those two things and still have difficulty with the man. He is intellegent, but also cold and unhelpful w/students.
He is extremely difficult.  He doesn't seem interested in helping his students do well.  He is extremely smart and gives you a lot of information.  It would be a great course if he was a little more personal.
Very good instructor and worth every dollar of tuition paid. I am going to take more courses from him.
Great prof","I had Dr. Cole as a prof. and and my college advisor during his time at McKendree College in Lebanon, IL.  He was still completing his PhD at St. Louis U. at the time.

273,"You have to go to this class every time unless you will be super lost. Take notes in class. Quizzes every Friday. Not hard unless you dont go. Shes a great teacher and makes the class super interesting.
Weekly quizzes. Long (but few) homework assignments. Labs can be hard to finish in time. That said, Peterman helped me a lot in class, always answering my questions well and quickly. She's a very engaging teacher, and tries to get to know the students personally. I learned a ton from lecture and labs. Seems tough at first, but she's a great prof.
Really great professor. Maybe makes it a little hard but wants students to do well and is always willing to help.
The professor was very rude, and surprisingly doesn't understand how technology works. She refused to adopt to new technologies and blames others for stuff not working properly. She should come to class a more prepare and have a better attitude. I would avoid taking any courses with her if possible. You will thank me later.
There's a 5 point quiz every Friday. Tests and labs are hard and there's a lot of homework.
She's extremely unorganized in lecture, so forget taking notes--it's an absolute mess. Labs are difficult and when you email her with questions she gives the shortest answer possible and sometimes the answers aren't even helpful. I dropped the class and am going to take it with a BETTER professor.
Professor Peterman is an excellent professor as she really cares about the students and wants to get to know everyone. The class was fun but also a lot of work. I learned so much from this class in just one small semester. This professor really encouraged hard work and always to do your best.
Peterman is a pretty good professor. Some students can find her to be a bit cold at first, but she's very helpful in her office hours and is easy to talk to after a little while. Grades homework hard, but labs pretty easy so it balances out. Come to class though, and be on time. You should enjoy.
Weekly quizzes. Have to go to class for participation. Her way or the highway. Condescending. Stays on topic of the most time. Not awful but not great, 5/10 recommend. Schools should focus on practical application for software and not pointless (and boring) projects. Visual basic is fun to learn/use so if you can zone her out, it won't be bad.
Peterman is often disliked for talking down to students, but I always viewed it as more of her just having fun with students in a snarky way. If you're easily offended, don't take her classes. She expects you to have a solid understanding of the fundamentals and won't answer basic questions. I went to her office hours and had a good experience.
Prof. Peterman is by far the worst professor I have ever had. She is extremely rude and will respond to you in the shortest, most brief way possible. While she is very knowledgable, lectures are unorganized do little to help students learn.  Homework and labs can be difficult because she expects you to do concepts never covered in class. Avoid her.
Truly a wonderful professor. She is tough but is fair. People who are posting saying that she is unhelpful probably didn't listen to her the first time. She doesn't like repeating herself, but if you have a legitimate question that you have made an effort to solve yourself, she is more than willing to help. Best professor I've ever had. 
She know's her stuff, and has a passion about it.  Cares about the performance of her students and encourages them to go the extra mile in assignments.  I learned a lot in her class.
Dont take if you have a choice. Her goal is to trip you up and get you with your grade. First day she always states she has tenure so she doesnt care what the students think. By far the worse professor in the GV computer program. She changes her requirments from class to class
She really has a lot to work on, starting with the way she teaches its not only demeaning but also annoying. I got out of there and in the future if you don't have to take her don't!!
Definitely drives the material due to quiz every week over chapters.  Class was very enjoyable.  Learned a lot and very much enjoyed her.
Very crude and demeaning to her students. If you go to her for better clearity she will send you away by telling you to re-read the book. On emails she replys with the least words possible giving no clearity of your problem. She isnt there to help her student suceed but to be a obstacle for her students to get over. Only professor for the course
Decent lectures, relevant material.  Kind of weird about helping with homework.  Makes you to struggle through the material sometimes, which gets old.  Fair grader though.
Do yourself a favor and do not get her.  If you ask her a question, she'll ask you if you read the textbook, and if you did she'll say just read it again. Not helpfull at all!
Talks about her family too much, extremely unhelpful in labs. You might as well do it yourself or take this class online. Class discussions very boring and you have too many labs to do in a little time.  Nice lady but I would get a different Professor.","Prof. Peterman is by far the worst professor I have ever had.

274,"Ok prof. His class is lecture heavy and he is very indirect when answering questions. I found it hard to understand his teaching style at first but as the semester went along I became more accustomed. He does a lot of examples in class and is very responsive when it comes to emails. overall not the worst professor Ive had, but couldve been better
Lectures notes are very messy, he's indirect when answering questions, exams are too long, he solves problems on the board extremely fast, goes over unnecessarily complex problems that will never be on exams which takes time away from solidifying/ the understanding of course topics,  should I go on? I hope you like weekend hw due dates :)
Professor Johnson loves Engineering. I took his class hoping to better understand if Engineering was for me, fortunately I did find out it wasn't for me. His assignments are very rubric based and very picky. If you change something you will be punished for it. He did seem very bold of himself which made me and a lot of others feel like pawns.
I took this class hoping to get a better idea if engineering was something I wanted to pursue. This was the wrong class to take. Johnson spent the entire semester just telling us the different fields of engineering you can pursue. The class was a waste of time, but you are pretty much only graded on attendance, so I couldn't skip.
Maybe he didn't like teaching EGR 100, because I thought he was great at EGR 214. He tells you what he expects, works out examples during class, encourages questions, works through problems people didn't understand from HW at beginning of class. He talks about experiences, but i guess people take it as ""bragging"". I don't really see it, though.
The beginning of the semester was confusing because it seemed backwards to what we learned in physics. He spent much of the semester trying to do what the new department head was trying to and not what he had planned out. He assigned online homework nearly every day it seemed, but never mentioned it in class. Not a bad choice in professor though.
Prof Johnson makes engineering boring! He covers VERY basic info we learned in middle school. He does have guest speakers come in which I did really like. If you're looking for an enthusiastic, great teacher he is not your guy. Class was easy though but it was just EGR 100.
This Professor is not my favorite. The reason why is because his teachings are extremely boring and have no enthusiasm what-so-ever. He brags on his background being very egotistic a lot of the times. It's very annoying because he is arrogant for no reason, and we're trying to get there. He knows his material, but have some gaps in teaching it.
Knows what he is talking about but is so boring. But half of the grade in this class is based on the fact of you showing up. He takes cheating very seriously and will kick you out of the university if he finds out
Dr. Johnson new the material very well. A little confusing at the beginning because he was teaching material backwards from the way I learned it. Once I realized that, everything was fine. Exams were very reasonable. Not overly hard, as long as you knew the material well enough.
Ever have that teacher that thought that they were an english major even though they literally knew nothing? Ever have a teacher that tries to make a class that is completely useless seem important? Well this is exhibit A. 
EGR 100 seemed like a great class for a student wanting to explore engineering, as we had many guest speakers come and talk about disciplines in which they taught in. While a few of them were good, many of them were pointless and consisted of the same stuff over and over. While he seems like a nice guy, but struggled using technology and boring.
Not a bad prof, homework is easy and if you study what he tells you to you'll do fine on the exams.
His class is very dry and boring. His teachings don't align with anything learned in prior circuits classes. He teaches from power points and has grading issues.
Class is VERY boring and it's not really helpful. All we did was go to class and hear him speak for two hours. Gave us four assignments. He's a picky grader. In some classes we had to disassemble a laptop and a printer and write papers about them.
Not a single word of this class description, including the title, was accurate. This class is essentially a semester of busywork chosen at random, with nothing to actually learn. The lectures are dry and rambling. The professor is a nice guy and I'm sure he's a great engineer, but I could have taken apart a printer on my own time and saved $1000+.
Not too bad of a class, could have been a lot more difficult. Dr. Johnson made it easier in some aspects but more difficult in others. Exams were not bad. Final was impossible, everyone was struggling.
Easy professor and class. All you need to do is go to class and turn in some form of the assignments to get an actually pretty good grade but I hated this guy so much that I skipped class quite often because I honestly couldn't bare what this guy was dishing out. MAYZURE MAYZURE
P.D.J. is terrible, he screwed up my grade and gave me a C when i had earned an A and after 3 months he finally returned an email saying he had changed it, overall this class has very little, if anything to do with engineering and makes me wonder how this was even a class, he didnt even know what we were going to do in our sylabus, steer clear!
Stay away.  Bad professor.  He is absolutely obsessed with printers and computers. Went into the class wanting to learn more about engineering and the class did not teach me anything i already didn't know.","This Professor is not my favorite.

275,"Amazing lecturer, makes class into a sort of performance.  Tough grader on papers.  Final Exam was the most difficult I've had but it was an Honors class.
As far as teaching the classics go, Levitan is great. He's funny, smart, and knows the material front to back. He explains things in a different way to help students better understand and get involved. This class was difficult, quizzes and tests called for specifics, but if you're interested in the classics, Levitan's your guy.
This class is definitely not an easy Gen Ed. The quizes were difficult, but not impossible. He expects a lot of commitment from his students. I really enjoyed the plays we read and for the most part, our class had decent discussions. The papers were not too hard but not too easy. Read the plays and you'll be fine.
Worst professor I have ever had and I have no idea how he has a smiley face.  He is incredibly unclear with his assignments and his quizzes are literally impossible to pass. DO NOT take if you want a good grade.  He is unhelpful during office hours and is incredibly hard to get a hold of.  Sucking up is only way to get a decent grade in this class.
I really liked taking Latin with Dr. Levitan.  He's a very good lecturer.  His tests can be brutal, but the opportunity to listen to him talk is well worth the difficulty.  Also, if you work hard you won't fail his classes.
Dr. William Levitan is the greatest teacher I have ever taken a class from.  After my first semester with Grand Valley, I made sure that I took at least one class with him every semester.  I have absolutely no regrets about that.
Do not take him. Hes the hardest professor i've ever had. He has questions on quizzes that were never covered and he just expects you to know everything. He tears apart your papers to and its near impossible to get a B or higher
Dr. Levitan has to have the sharpest wit of any person I have ever known. His humor is fantastic, and it is even funnier when 3/4 of the class is too dumb to get the jokes! That aside, Levitan is a damn good lecturer and professor. Has HIGH expectations, but is VERY willing to help you get there. The BEST professor to take regarding anything Roman!
Extremely difficult class. His humor is confusing at first, but you'll love listening to his jokes by the end of the semester. He is passionate about Roman literature, but sometimes wants you to come up the ideas he wants to hear when you have no idea what's going on. Gave us a music lesson too :)
Awesome guy. very funny and passionate about classics. his lectures are not the most entertaining and his quizzes are riculously hard. attendance is a must if you want a good grade.
He was mean to our class.... Didn't understand how we had problems grasping Latin concepts. He used a lot of technical terms about the language we were trying to learn, we moved at a sluggish pace of not even two chapters over 5 weeks. He's got a good sense of humor... Just not such a good professor.
Awesome prof - cares about his students and is always willing to discuss questions with you in office hours.  Awesome sense of humor, but definitely likes to talk.  He not only teaches you about the subject matter, but also teaches you to think.  Be sure to ask him to do the strophe dance (and antistrophe) :-)
I loved him but I could see where some people might not. He did a wonderful job getting into the text and explaining the details that might have been missed. I don't think he was a hard grader he just knows what he wants. He was REALLY bad about the papers in that he waited to the LAST min to give them out. He is also extremely friendly and helpful
I hated this class.  Prof was great at lecturing 10 minutes past the class period was over.  He totally knew his stuff, but also how to put you to sleep with it.  He grades super super hard on papers, and there are only three for your whole grade.  Take this prof if you like to sleep in class and get bad grades.
I love this guy, almost as much as he loves the Iliad. He's very bright and funny to boot. There's lots of discussion in this class, and he likes to make you think about things rather than just telling you. Honestly, I could never have enjoyed classical literature without him.
funny guy, decent sense of humor, lecture everyday all class period, hard grader - the hardest one I've encountered thus far at lovely gv. That's all.
Probably the WORST professor I have ever had.  So boring that not only did half of the class sleep, but so did the other professor.
By far one of the best professors here. Hard grader and slightly intimidating due to immense intelligence, but a great guy and wonderful prof.
Levitan is intelligent and so sometimes a difficult grader. He challenges you in writing and in class discussion. However, he is extremely passionate and often shows a great sense of humor. He knows what he's talking about and his passion can be contagious. He is an enjoyable professor when lecturing though his grading can be scary.
He's very fun to listen to - he at least has a good sense of humor.  He grades papers on the tough sides, but he's trying to make you think.  Although his answers are not always clear, he'll explain whatever you need again.",I loved him but I could see where some people might not. He did a wonderful job getting into the text and explaining the details that might have been missed. I don't think he was a hard grader he just knows what he wants. He was REALLY bad about the papers in that he waited to the LAST min to give them out. He is also extremely friendly and helpful
278,"He definitely treats this lower level class way more seriously than need be. I wouldn't have passed if I hadn't already had a background in music. I tutored students in this class to help them get their grades from a D to a B. Very harsh grading, but he really knows this subject back and forth. Super organized and clear. He's just not very personal
I went into MUS 129 thinking it would be an easy gen ed due to my 10 years of music experience. However, I quickly learned that this class did not match the course description and was harder than it needed to be.
used up every single second of class time and gave a lot of homework, the class also just was not interesting 

Prof. Martin has  tarnished my enjoyment of music. Before taking his class, I really wanted to keep doing stuff with music through college, but he killed a lot of the fun in it for me. He's a very harsh and rude professor, and the way he teaches his class and the way he grades reflects that. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO!!!
This class was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. Attendance was mandatory and he would mark you if you came in a minute late. Tests were extremely hard, and no one ever did well on them in my class. He teaches us as if we are musical prodigies, not people taking the class for a gen-ed. I wouldn't even make my worst enemy take this class. 
Prof Martin is passionate in what he teaches but he treats his class like they're middle schoolers in terms of knowledge about music. He demands we be on time and respect his time but he isn't prepared for class when it starts and is late when coming back from break. He drones on and makes the class uninteresting and makes you dislike the content.
Prof. Martin teaches like a high school teacher. He focuses more on following unnecessary rules than teaching. Rules include non to few restroom breaks per class, marking students tardy for showing up even a minute late, grading on absences, and leaving early regardless of the reason. While his lectures are okay, his attitude makes him intolerable.
Hard and not helpful
He was such a fun professor. He wasn't as fun in class but outside of class he was great to talk to and worked with you if you needed anything. The lectures are mainly just review what's in the book but really pay attention when doing the listenings. The tests are hard but they are manageable.
This class is just misleading, I wouldn't take it if you do not have any music experience. I have 11 years of music. It is titled ""fundamentals of music"" but is a music theory class, which I think are completely different. So first, the title needs to change. Second, he is very picky with how you write music so make sure you learn how he likes it. 
At the beginning of this class prof said you didn't need any musical experience or knowledge to pass. I personally have 7+ years of musical experience and I had to work hard for my grade. The one saving grace for this class is that prof teaches 97% of the material on the tests, but the lectures move quickly.
Prof. Martin cares about his work to a point it really feels excessive, especially for a 100-level course. It feels assumed that you have extensive musical experience coming into the course (I came in with years of Violin experience from HS and still struggled) glancing over hard topics. It makes learning the 'basics' feel like a 300-level course.
I took MUS 100 for my art credit thinking it wouldn't be too difficult as I had lots of music experience--I was wrong. He lectures very quickly from the minute class starts until the very end and doesn't stop for questions. Tests are okay but you need to know lots of material, which he barely teaches. Wouldn't recommend him
took this class for an art credit and dropped it halfway through the semester as this class was hard (even if you have had music history) and the prof just expects you to understand everything right away.
I stand by the fact that Music 129 was the hardest class I've taken thus far. Professor Martin made is so much harder than it had to be and the man is a hard-ass about EVERYTHING. I thought I would've done fine, and I should've been, since I've done band for 10 years. Pick a different prof unless you want to devote your entire semester to a gen ed.
I did not like Professor Martin at all. He says you do not need musical experience, but you most definitely do. If you miss any classes or aren't paying attention 100% of the time, you will fall behind in the class really quickly. When we moved online, he was terrible. The videos were barely legible. He also only calls you to answer questions.
Looked through this app to find the best music teacher and of course last minute GVSU swtiched the professor to this guy. PICK A DIFF PROF. For a gen ed class, this guy took everything way too seriously and made it harder than it had to be for no reason at all. He was rude and when he lectured, he would go so fast and wouldn't explain things well
Walked in one second late to class and he said he needed to see me after. After class he was extremely rude to me about it. Even though attendance isn't supposed to be mandatory this year becuase of covid, he said ""technically attendance isn't mandatory, but you can't pass without participation in class"". so basically made it mandatory anyway.
my review is a bit biased because music comes easier to me than most people, but professor martin was still great. straight to what you need to know, no bs or time wasted in class which i appreciate. hes pretty serious but not a bad professor at all.
He seems nice but takes music too seriously. Acts like all his students should be trained professionals. Doesnt slow down and isnt very clear. If you play an instrument you should be fine but if you dont know anything about music, stay away.","Prof. Martin teaches like a high school teacher.

280,"The biggest challenge was to seperate his redactionist expression from the actual theories he tried to teach.  While his interpretation of a partiuclar theory was interesting, it wasn't always correct.  I was plagued in my graduate study to read the works of many theorists again because his perspective was not quite accurate.
This guy yelled at his class to try and make some kind of impression.  He boasts of an obligation to fight the system and do right but he ignores the same ethical issues that happen at the university.  Easy A.  Poor law to the welfare state was a boring book.
Just before a meeting, I asked him for advice on what to do.  His advice was clear and specific, ""Tell 'em to go to hell!""  I asked him to clarify and he said it again, ""Tell 'em to GO TO HELL!"" with an expectation for me to say it 10 minutes later.  I was initialy impressed by his NASW commitments made in SW150. However, he didn't follow through.
He tried to impress the class by yelling, he amplified the role of NASW acting as if it was as powerful as APA, his lectures were tied between one of his tangents and the text book.  It's an easy A.  He is not a man of his word. I challenged him when GVSU violated Code of Ethics and he didn't do what he said he would. It's just a front.
Terrible!  Very condasending and demeaning towards students.  Yells at students for various minor things and does not listen to students.  Get out if you have a chance!!!
Really a good prof.  Lectures can be boring and off topic, but he means well.  Pretty amusing at times, too.  Incredibly fair grader.  Read what is required, don't show up late or miss too many classes and you'll be fine.
Fonzie is da bomb diggity!! BEST TEACHER AT GVSU!! take him you won't regret it. he's easy on the eyes.   he's like a kid in a social science store!!!!
Dr. Haynes is an interesting prof. Good at answering questions and discusses material well with students in class.  His exams are a breeze if you study well.  I heard horror stories about his demeanor/teaching style, but he really is cool. He is accomodating and helpful.  In class he demands order, follow the rules, he is nice and you'll be ok
Very intimidating.  Demands strict adherence to NASW code of ethics but justifies violation in lecture and advising sessions.  Yells in class at the top of his lungs.  Teaches from the book on occassion otherwise rambles on.  Deviates from a large syllabus. Made offensive personal remarks in class.
AWFUL prof obviously enjoying tenure. Calls students work ""garbage"" in front of the class. Then wants to skin and grin on the day of student evaluations and pay compliments. Once the entire Jr. class in the Sch of SW asked for his removal if that lets you know what kind of a prof he is. A real POS.
Al Haynes gets a bad rep. Give him a chance & visit his office once, just to shoot the breeze about SW & listen to what he has to say. Most of the people who don't like him don't listen to him. He's old and has a lot of good advice. Has a good NY accent.
It is truely hard to believe he is a SW prof. He is the worst prof i have ever taken. You will learn nothing from the class unless you take the time to read the book. The highlights of the class were guest speakers!!
YAwnnnnnn...wow that class was boring. He is a crazy old man that says, ""Think about it"" after every sentence. Also, he tells stories that just prove he is senial.
This class was boring but it was an easy A.  All you have to do is show for all your classes and your bound to pass.  Last 4 weeks of class is presentations.  We didn't even have to take the final and the midterm was had only 25 questions on it.
This class has a syllabus three times thicker than any amount of work you have to do. Attendance is necessary but for what? To sit through a lecture about...what? Reading, for what? He should have stayed doing social work in the field, and not
He grades you on whether he likes you or not. No clarity what so ever, no tests, nothing. He ends up telling stories about his family over and over, each time a slightly different way.
Learned nothing in his class and made me turn away from Social Work.  Don't take him.
Very inconsistent, often rude and unwilling to help. Be sure to stand up for yourself even if you think it won't do any good- do not let him intimidate you! Needs to learn about respect for others.
Hard to believe he works in the SW field.  Unfair grader, KNOW YOUR APA FORMAT...Take other prof if possible.
He is the WORST proff I have ever had. At times he is pretty funny, but everything depends on his mood that day. he just rambles on and on about stories that are useless thro the course.",Very intimidating.

282,"I really enjoyed my class with Professor Witt.  I ended up doing an independent study with him.
Easy A if u do the readings. He isnt that bad just likes discussion. Readings are exactly whats on the tests. Class is kind of interesting and so are the readings. Really, people...It's an easy class to boost your gpa.
Professor Whit is gone!  :-(  Does anybody know what happened to him?
This is a great class. He is an interesting old man. Easy A if u just do the readings. Everything that is in the readings is on the tests. Forget what the others are saying he is really nice. he just likes class discussion. Take him!!!
Prof. Whitt taught me more than any other achademic teacher this semester. He doesn't buy in to all of the lies of society, and is open minded. If you disagre with him he's cool with it and wants to learn more about what you believe and why you believe it. He's also pretty good at Tai Chi.
He's a crazy old hippy with a ponytail. That is all.
I liked Prof. Whit as a person, but as a teacher he was horrible. He doesn't give you guidance as to what he includes on tests and quizzes. He is disorganized,jumbled in thought, and lectures only about tennis mate and not important sociology. Prepare to read a lot and be guided very little.
Can you say BORING! I'd rather sit and count all the strands in my head then listen to his a** talk. The things he discuss aren't even relavant to the classwork. Don't take his class because you will be ready to slit your wrist during lecture.
Was an alright teacher, hard to follow at times, but not too bad.  Got 2 papers back from him covered in protein shake, which was kinda unprofessional, not bad overall.
Good prof, makes you think.  His stories seem irrelivant, but if you pay attention you'll realize they're not. Go to office hours, he'll love you and give you a better grade, dont ask dumb questions, read the book.  Well worth taking, you'll learn alot.
I think he is senile. He repeats the same damn boring stories over and over. Doesn't give review sheets. His 3 hour class made me insane enough to chew on my own arm. By the end of the class, I am laughing maniacally in the back of the class like a RAVING LUNATIC.  I need some Valium or something!
Awful professor...refuses to stay on topic.  but he does tell some funny personal stories.  Every paper I got back had some food or smudge on it from him. Try to take a different class because even though it sounds interesting at first it is very frustrating to sit through
Whit's cool, he's just old and all old people are all about themselves, you know how it is. hmm... anyway if you have an open mind and can control your laughter while he does tia chi than take him, or something. dont take him too far 'cause i kinda like him.
Worst Prof every.  All he talks about is himself and wanting to live in Cuba.  He is very one sided and boring.  Did i mention boring.  RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!
Worst professor ever! All he does is talk about himself and never covers anything we are actually supposed to know. The tests are the hardest. Avoid this class at all costs.
""Your garunteed to walk out of this class with at least a B""  These are some of his first words to you when you come to class.  He is rather entertaining, not a bad guy outside of class, but not really a great teacher.  the class is wotrh a shot, and really not as bad as other have made it out to be
If you ever take one piece of advise from me (even though I don't know you) do not take his class. he is horrible and crabby and pointless. his class is ""besides the point."" he makes you work hard for something that is never clearly identified. waste of time and money and sanity.
Well meaning prof, class isn't hard, gets off topic very easily.  Grades easy.  Not a bad guy, but not a great prof
Awful professor. Wastes time with irrelevant stories that have NO point. Does not communicate expectations well at all. Putting your teeth on a curb and letting someone kick you in the back of the head would be more fun than enduring this man's lectures. Avoid at all costs
Very mean guy, I've loved all my profs here so far, but not him. He's very rude and uncaring","Your garunteed to walk out of this class with at least a B  These are some of his first words to you when you come to class.

285,"Professor Rogness a great guy. I had him for STA 216 online with zooms. You never had to attend, only if you had questions on the homework or tests. It is team based learning but I never talked to my group and only went to class to ask questions when needed and it was fine. A little test heavy, but prof will help you whenever you need it!
Professor Rogness is a great person, he cares about his students and is very helpful. He is always willing to answer questions and giving feedback to students. If you don't like team based learning, this may not be the choice for you.
Super sweet, funny guy. He was a licensed funeral home director who ended up pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics. Lectures are incredibly memorable, as he prepares often humorous activities that keep you involved and learning throughout the hour. Assignments and exams were reasonable, and the labs were genuinely fun. An absolute must-take professor.
Very nice guy and really does care about you succeeding. He's fair in his grading and is always available for help. There's a decent amount of work you'll have to do outside of class, but nothing unmanageable. STA 216 has a tiny bit of coding in it, but he's good at teaching it so even if you have no programming background there's no need to worry.
This class has group learning so if that's what you like this is for you. This means you teach yourself all the material. He is a tough grader and will mark you down for anything wrong. There are 5-6 long homework assignments & about three exams. You get cheat sheets & I suggest working outside of class with your group it helps!
Prof Rogness is a nice guy but be careful taking this class. It is purely on YOU to do well and teach yourself everything. Zero lectures are given and everything is done as a group (except exams) so if you are the type that needs a clear lecture, take a different prof. Exams are pretty difficult.
The class was fairly disorganized, and I did not like it very much. I don't think you have a choice in which prof teaches this class. Just get started on your client project early and it won't be so bad.
Taught through team based learning meaning where you are in a group of 5 and you work together the entire semester on in class activities and such. I am horrible at math, but I actually did really great because of this teaching style. However he doesn't lecture, you read the chapters and then work through activities with your group to learn
So this is his first semester teaching STA 215 and its not good. He's a nice guy, but he's teaching through team based learning meaning he doesn't teach. If you are good at reading and understanding math you'll do fine. If not, seriously pick another prof. How it goes: Read>take individual quiz>take group quiz>do group activities>HW>test
NEAL ROGNESS IS THE BEST PROF AT GVSU. Literally so helpful whenever you need extra help, makes sure that the class actually understands what's going on before moving on, and makes information relevant/easy to understand. Go to office hours and study the labs and you'll do well on exams. NEAL IS A GEM.
Neal is a great professor and will help you learn stats very well. Make sure to always go to class because you'll fall behind and he does give a lot of help during class.
Neil's a great guy! He's very kind, accessible, and really makes a dry topic like survey methods interesting. I would greatly recommend him as a stats professor; he knows the ins and outs very well and makes class feel very welcoming. Make sure you put in the work and you'll do well. :)
Neal is incredibly nice and caring person. Survey Sampling is a somewhat dry topic. Show up every day, put in the time with the SAS homework, and make a good cheat sheet for exams and you're good. Book is used quite a bit. He's very clear and is always looking to help the students.
Rogness was an awesome prof. He is always willing to help students. If you study extensively for the midterm and final (his only tests), you will be fine. He is picky with grading (I got marked for not stapling my paper!). I feel like he did not explain SAS as good as he could but overall, great prof. I recommend.
He's really cool but nit picky when it comes to written assignments. He'll mark off for spelling errors or not enough information. It's a stats class, not an English one! If you are a skilled writer you should be fine though. He's not the greatest at explaining how to program SAS in the beginning, That's why I rated him moderately on explaining.
The epitome of a red chili pepper!
Smart, kind, decent, and yes...worthy of a red chili pepper!
This professor is very helpful, just ask if you have a question!  He keeps his class fun by using a variety of teaching methods.  TAKE HIM FOR STA 215!
Great professor! Really takes the time to help you understand the material- happy to give one-on-one and explains concepts well. Uses a ""course pack"" which can be bought at the bookstore for $8. Don't use the book a whole lot, for problems every once in a while. Very easy going. Gives you a full page (8.5 x 11) cheat sheet for exams. 10 pt. quizzes
Alright let me give you 411. This is a really nice, and helpful professor, BUT along with that he is also disorganized, only explains the bare minimum if you dont ask him, and marks down for such things as spelling typos. If you dont mind having to tediously go through all your assignments to make sure theyre perfect then take him. Your call.","Rogness was an awesome prof. He is always willing to help students.

287,"His teaching style is really bad. He somehow manages to ramble for 2 hours about material that should only take a half hour to teach. He is a very hard grader on the homework but the exams are pretty easy. If you talk to him at his office hours he will usually let you redo your homework for points back which is great. I wouldn't recommend him.
Don't take this professor! Such a waste of the students' time and money. The class was a joke and I am no better off with his teaching.
Ron puts himself on a pedestal, only answers your questions with a run around of your question, had ""meetings"" in his office for no apparent reason, wasted a lot of time, completely useless. I think he just liked having the complete control over his class, I felt like a puppet.
Absolutely useless class, learned nothing wasted time and tuition dollars.  Prof is a complete joke, does not answer direct questions, class requires more work than any other gen-ed class at this school.  I truthfully believe this school is worse off for having this class and prof on campus.
He had a unique style of teaching...that kept me interested in the topics.  Attention of the students was held very well.
He used many examples, such as readings, videos, puzzles and newspaper clippings to relate information to the course.  Very available to students.
Prof. G. really made me think.  He is very approachable and has a great sense of humor.  One of the best profs I have ever had.  He is supremely helpful with out of class work.
Worthless class.  Only took it because I had to.  The man treats us like we are 7 years old.  Horribly unclear with assignments and teaches us nothing over the course of the semester.  Waste of perfectly good time and money.  Do not recomend the teacher or the class.  Avoid if possible.
DO NOT RECCOMEND.
Excects way to much. lots of work.
This man is the messiah of divergent thinking. He's a good man with a good heart, but he is a little unclear about things. Just keep asking him to explain things and he will edventually. Don't have it at 8 am cuz its impossible to motivate yourself to go to. Be wary, he uses ""etc"" a lot and he is quite the ""futurist""
The class in itself is boring enough, but coupled with a prof. as incompetent as he is?  Well, lets just say that when i did manage to motivate myself to go to class, I wished that i hadn't. Don't expect to learn anything. In fact, don't take this professor. Or the class. I do not recommend him at all. Drop the class if you know whats good for you.
This was the most pointless, boring class I have ever taken. The professor is very unclear regarding what is expected of you and his grading is all over the place. He is a nice guy and seems to care about his students, but his class was a waste of time and a lot of work. I wouldn't recommend him nor would I recommend LIB 100 in general.
I enjoyed the class very much and learned a great deal about myself and how other people think; Techniques on innovation were awesome -- readings were helpful
He is a very boring teacher. The class is pointless because it has no direction and will leave you in a state of frustration.
I couldn't stand the class. I learned one thing all semester. Pointless waste of a 3 hour class. I often wondered if he was dropped on his head as a child or something.
Horrible professor. Do not take this class unless you have to.  Very unclear, boring lectures that are a waste of time.  Never lets class out early.  Expects too much work outside of class. Run..........
class was a waste of time. I left each week not knowing what was supposed to have been learned. The weekly work was tremendous, but fairly easy. The final project was hyped up all semester but ended up being just a PP presentation.
The King of filling up class time, dont ever expect to get out of class early. Oh yeah and he is an ass clown who thinks this is the only class you are taking, **** this guy.","This was the most pointless, boring class I have ever taken.

288,"really good professor
Incredible teacher. Take this class. So willing to help. exams are not bad. 
Best class I have ever taken in USC. He was so enthusiastic about what he teaches, always willing to help his students or to discuss anything with his students. Exams are writing essays based on readings and lectures. there's no right/wrong answer but you need to develop your arguments logically. Pay attention to his lectures and do the readings!
Professor Von Blum is one exciting, inspiring and intelligent man. He is extremely engaging with his students, managing to get impressive participation in a class get participation in a 120 person class. He encourages you to think about apathy, inequality, racism, war, patriarchal society. Yells at first, but honestly cares about his students!
Took his course at USC on censorship and the 1st amendment. Would definitely recommend him to any student. He is a very passionate educator with lots of life and educational experience. He talks loud and is bold. Midterm and final only -- essay style. Loved this class.
Professor Von Blum is by far my favorite professor at UCLA. His stories are great, he challenges you with intriguing scenarios, is extremely passionate about his subject, and truly cares about his students. I really have no negatives to say; I am even pursuing an individual studies course with him in the fall!
I took courses with Paul Von Blum at U.C. Berkeley over 35 years ago.  He was a highlight of my college experience.  I still think about the books we read (The Plague, Miss Lonelyhearts, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, etc.) as well as the artists we studied (Hogarth, Goya, Daumier, etc.)  Thank you, Paul, for everything!
I took several of his pol sci classes at UC Irvine 20 yrs ago and thought so highly of him that I recently looked him up to see if he was still at UCLA.  He challenged us with moral and ethical scenarios which made us think and some didn't like it.  I loved it and thought he was very brave to push the envelope on taboo subjects.BEST Teacher EVER!
I took Paul's class over 13 years ago.  He helped shape my understanding of the world.  I learned a lot about Paul Robeson, who continues to inspire me, and about public art.  Good teachers question the way we think about the world and they force us to ask ourselves questions far after the exams are over.  I recommend that everyone take him.
Anyone reading this....I took two courses with Paul in the mid-70's at Berkeley.  35 years later, I can tell you he changed my life.  What he teaches is how to think and communicate.  Whatever you do in your life...those are the most important tools.
Itrs professors like Von Blum that make UCLA prestigious and worthy of anything. He's been in the UC system I believe for over 20 years begining with Berkeley.. part of the Civil Rights movement.. I cant say more than passionate & experienced to describe him. You must take a class with him to make your education worth anything!
At first I did not want to go to class during the summer because basically I did not have to for the grade was based on two essays. But the passion and quality of this teacher made me want to go just to hear him talk and engage in the interesting conversations. I RECOMMEND THIS TEACHER!
This class was soo long that it could get kinda boring, but professor Von Blum is the type that will go out of his way to help you understand and grasp the information. I recomend him just another course.
EXCELLENT PROF! MUST TAKE AT LEAST ONCE WHILE AT UCLA!
I would not call this man a teacher, but more a speaker. He is a very passionate speaker. However, I had no idea what he wanted us to retain. I did not know what to take down in my notes. I think it is completely unfair that some TAs grade harsher than others. It is an easy grade if you have easy TAs. If you are a great writer, you should be fine.
He's an amazing teacher! The discussions in class - the way he leads them w/out you even noticing it -, his points and questions, the topics, the works, etc. were excellent. AND he's  there for his students anytime.
I disagree with the previous review. My discussion sections with my TA helped glue everything from lecture and readings together. I did very well in the class and found my TA to be very accessible and helpful. If you write well and convincingly, participate in discussion, and attend sections, you'll get an easy A.
He is very passionate about his teaching, but the grades are not in line with what you learn.  Poor TAs that lack communication skills.  He is a great guy with interesting lectures, but the graded system is all subjective and is not objective.

290,"Prof Stewart is amazing. For Writing Fiction, she makes you feel at ease, especially when you have to turn your writing in for critiques from the class. She makes the classroom a safe space.
One of my favorite professors to talk to. She is very understanding so if you were running late to class or couldn't turn a paper in right away, she worked with you as long as you communicated with her. She was easy to approach for help and made the class fun. Lots of readings, but only three papers so not too intense for work.
We had certain readings we would have to read out of the book and then she would go through them each class. Lots of reading but I would recommend it is very interesting and helpful. Quizzes every two weeks on readings. Sometimes class got boring. 3 papers total with the final. Some in class assignments or discussion. Very easy grader.
She is one of the nicest professors I have had, and one of the best classes. It is easy to tell that she cares about the class. After each paper we wrote she always brought in cupcakes, and brought a bunch of snacks and coffee to the final. You have to read the literature, but there are only three papers and they are not difficult.
Professor Stewart was wonderful in ENGL 2230 African American Literature. The subjects covered are interesting. She usually lectures for about 20 mins then the class splits into groups. There were 5 quizzes (lowest score dropped), one paper, and a final exam. If you show up to class, participate, and study for the quizzes the class is not difficult!
I wish she taught EVERY class I need to take, and every class I will ever take. Even after the semester was over, we still talked often. I am rather honored to be the reason that the final project has a page limit. ^_^
Vicki was an awesome instructor for GWS 1000.  Likely an easy A course.  I may be a bit borderline because I didn't do so hot on the quizzes.  Not a lot of work, 5 quizzes (4 counted for score), 1-2 reaction papers (3 pages) and 1 research paper (5-7 pages).  
I had to laugh at the earlier post. Yes you do have to rewrite a rough draft which would be why its a rough draft. There is a lot of writing but if you are always planning to attend class you know what you are doing
There is a LOT of homework. Tons of writing but all of it is able to be reworked for final grade. She doesnt grade you until you turn in your final paper and lets you bring a rough draft to class so you can get help.  If you show up for class, pay attention, you will get an A
This is a pretty difficult class. LOTS of homework/writing. I honestly did more homework in this class than Biology (BIOS 1120). She isn't clear on assignments, so I usually have to rewrite my drafts before turning in the final assignment. She is very willing to help, but I find working one on one with her (such as at her office hours) more helpful
Ok, I failed but I failed because I didnt get help when I needed it and it was offered. She looked as dispaokingted as I was wehn she gave me back my papers.  Im going to see if I can get her again and not screw it up this time
Ran into her two years after having her class. Once she changed into her seeing glasses she not only remembered me, chatted about what I was studying because she remember what I was going for and reminded me even if I am not her student if I ever need help shes there.  Just a good person, not only a good teacher
Trying to get in, trying to get in anyone i asks always has only good things to say.  Sent me a really nice email back even though she couldnt help me get in cause she is full again :(
Her class is ALWAYS full, I got in during dops and adds and glad I did.  She isn't kidding, she WILL halp you outside of the classroom if you just dont get it even if it means walking you through the whole lecture.
Of all my profs this semester she is the only one that took the time to talk to me like I was an equal.  Her class is someplace you want to go when its time for class.  Don't let her fool you though, she is smarter then anyone I have ever met but she isn't condensending EVER. I have never had a teacher I would want as a friend, her I would
She is very helpful. As long as u participate and bring in u'r own ideas, the class is fine. She listens to everyone and tries to be very fair. Can be weird at times,but that's what makes her interesting. She is nice outside of the class also. Dont try to snow her on the stuff you research.  SHE WILL HAVE READ AND REMEMBER RIGHT DOWN TO PARAGRAPH
Easily the best professor that I have ever had. She is clear, knowledgeable, and always interested in what you have to say. She helps anyone who needs it, even if it has nothing to do with the class and will help you with every step to reach your goals. Inspirational, supportive, and requires more than 350 characters to describe.
I was never good at writing papers, even in a college prep high school. She really made it a point to help me, and make my papers and quizzes the best they could be. She is a little weird at first, but you realize that it is all part of how great she is. GET THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU CAN!!!
I have her this semester.  At first I thought okay she's weird.  But then I needed to get extra help because highschool didnt prepare me for making term papers beyond the five paragraph essay.  She makes extra time, or as she put it, your willig to do the extra work to get better, Im here to help and will work to.   GET THIS TEACHER IF YOU CAN
I thought for sure I would fail.  I suck at english and grammar.  After the first paoper she had see me on it.  I thought i was going to be in troubl or she would sy find another class.  Insted she walked me through every mistake until I could fix themmyself for the next pper.  if you need a prof who cares she is it.","Easily the best professor that I have ever had.

292,"sisay asefa is the best teacher at WMU. He is very helpful and specific. Any question you have he answers clearly and makes sure you understand the material. I would take him every class if I could.
He is really good and he knows what he is doing.
Great professor. Easy A class
Great teacher, understanding and respectful. He cares for his students. And will never fail one. This is The best teacher ever.
One of the best professors Ive ever had for economics. Honestly really helpful and his class is so easy to pass with an A. Highly recommend
Good professor learned a lot highly, highly recommended. In the class you run a factory producing beer you have to deal with inventory issues and the like fun class plus he gives money to the top team or person every week. The material does require time to understand though
We met twice a semester. We didn't have any assignments, it was just 4 tests. I'm bad at econ, so I struggled, but I know other people did not. The tests were all timed and online with a huge question bank. If you take this class, take the tests in groups, you'll do better. He offered some extra credit but it was going to his events during the day.
I have taken probably 60-70% of my classes on-line between the colleges I've gone to and this is in my top 3 of terrible online classes. A professor friend of mine looked at the first exam and apologized for how ridiculously difficult the test was. Apparently this professor expects us all to have a PHD in economics already. Terrible class.
Professor Asefa is pretty awful. I gave him a chance at the beginning, despite the fact that I could barely understand him. That went out the window after the first exam. It's open book/notes/internet, but the tests are STILL insanely tough! I don't recommend taking this with him.
Very nice man!  Always willingg to help students. Great listener! Quiet and intelligent man!
This class is easy, just study each chapters multiple choice review questions for the online part of the book.  Most test questions are directly off the reviews. If you show up to class a week before the exam he gives you all the answers for the reviews.
Worst teacher I've ever had in my entire educational career.  Complained to the dean about him. The dean said they get complaints all the time but there is nothing they can do about it.  Attending lecture is pointless as he is incomprehensible some days.  Better off staying home and memorizing the powerpoints he post since he just reads from them.
He lectures all class off his power points, sometimes he is barely audible as he speaks so quietly. Difficult class, doesn't explain the material very well.
I hated this professors teaching style the lectures do not help with the tests.Even reading the book didnt help on the test because the test had small details that you wouldnt think were important because they were not covered in class. The first day of class he told us not to complain to the head of the department because he wouldnt do anything.
Took this class online.  The teacher was no help at all, never responds to your emails.  Tests were okay because they were multiple choice and directly from the practice tests.
this man can not teach, he mumbles to the board. he got a thick accent. you get nothing out of this class, save your time and effort for something useful
I absolutely HATED this class with a passion. The tests are all multiple choice but nothing that you studied for is on the exam.  I complained about him to the chairman of economics and he told me that even he agrees that he isn't the greatest.  DO NOT TAKE!!
I absolutely HATED this class with a passion.  He reads off the powerpoints and you cannot understand him anyway.  The tests are all multiple choice but nothing that you studied for is on the exam.  I complained about him to the chairman of economics and he told me that even he agrees that he isn't the greatest.  DO NOT TAKE!!
can't understand a word he is saying which makes lecture pointless to attend. only tests make up your grade..
Terrible teacher, nobody ever came to class and the tests had random questions from the book that required you to know obscure information from the book which is very long and dry.  Even after class, didnt post final exam grade he still wont give it to me.screwed up a test mid semester and used the wrong answer key....tried to tell us we were wrong",Worst teacher I've ever had in my entire educational career.  Complained to the dean about him. The dean said they get complaints all the time but there is nothing they can do about it.  Attending lecture is pointless as he is incomprehensible some days.

294,"I really enjoyed this class. She was very sweet and gave real life advice. There wasn't too much homework. Just reading and discussion.
Worst professor ever. Attendance is ""mandatory,"" but she doesn't actually take 10% of your grade off after 2 skips. Final grade was based off of one assignment a tutoring portfolio that she was very picky on. She gave us what should be in it the day it was due. Gives the same lecture over and over. Very unorganized.
Professor Schneider was not my favorite. She was unclear with what she wanted. She would get off topic all the time with material that wasn't relevant to the class. If you asked for help, you wouldn't get a straight answer/explanation. She's a nice lady, but an average professor.
Dr. Schneider is an amazing lady! She is super encouraging and engaging! She is passionate about her work and teaching! However finals projects and what is excepted in unclear. Don't stress however, jut be creative, that's all she wants to see! Also seriously read all of the books! It will help with pop quizzes and portfolio! I totally take again!
She isn't the best prof by any means,but I have had much worse. Can be very rude and will tell crazy long stories that don't even matter. Doesn't explain assignments clearly but if you put hard work into them, you will be fine. You won't know how you are doing till the end of the semester-she NEVER posts grades. Try to take another prof if you can.
Worst professor I have ever had! The class itself is pretty easy, but you won't learn a thing and you will leave every class feeling like your time is being wasted. The worst part of this class  is Prof Schneider herself. She is constantly making discriminatory remarks about groups of people and about students in the class! AVOID!
There was a lot of reading in this class; however, they were all interesting children's books that once I started reading, I couldn't put down. The read alouds were well worth the time, and they weren't difficult whatsoever. I enjoyed the class, even her long stories.
Worst English course/professor I have had in my 5 yrs at GVSU. She is always off schedule, but does not update the students about the schedule changes. She based more than half of our grade on a final project she did not provide an assignment sheet or guidelines for. She is rude to students and arrogant-though not very knowledgeable. Avoid her.
She veers off topic & never answers questions directly. She's unwilling to see error in her ways even when the entire class is confused & frustrated. When I asked for clarification on behalf of the class, she became defensive, sarcastic, & condescending, as though I was at fault for her lack of clarity. I've never had such an unpleasant experience.
I really liked this professor.  Everything that you learn is really relevant.  This class is mostly about the tutoring that you will do and how to do it. She talks a lot, but I found what she had to say interesting and I learned a lot. She is also flexible and doesn't overload you with work because you are already doing so much for the tutoring.
I don't know what everyone is talking about she is am awesome professor. Yes she may ramble on a bit but I learned so much from her. She goes out of her way to help you in any way she can. She shows empathy which is not common these days. She also does not have tests and her ""pop"" quizzes are super easy. TAKE HER FOR SURE!
She's a very sweet lady and really enjoys discussion.  If you get a good class with a few people who carry the discussion she will always be happy and you'll get very few quizzes.  There is only one paper and two literary circles.  I recommend taking this class!
She's crazy. She talks all the time, and it didn't typically concern the topic at hand. She always has a story to tell and will take an hour to tell one. I didn't learn anything in her class, but she was a nice lady. I would not recommend her at all. Pop quizzes on text were specific and the class was a waste of my time and money spent.
Run. Please don't take this lightly.  She is rude; she interrupts constantly.  I can honestly say I learned NOTHING in her class. Save your money, your time, and your sanity.
She tore people apart on their lesson plans after having given no guidelines for them or expectations.  She takes off points if you don't buy the books even though other than for this reason you won't need all of them.  She will either give pop quizes on what you havent read or will go on and on about something you just read and does not need this
Very disrespectful!  She told everyone to drop her class the first day.  She told students they should have nothing else going on in their lives because her class takes priority.  Then she told everyone to drop her class...again.
Talks a lot. Doesn't really help students out much or communicate about grades, grading, or expectations. Always has a story to go with whatever she's going over. As a result, the class I took with her covered only 7 of the 11 books I had to buy for it. Knowledgable, but a time-waster. If you're going to spend that much time, make it a 3 hour class
Very nice and interesting professor however like most of the comments, she tends to talk about the texts but then has a story abotu herself to go along with it. Never returned any assignments until AFTER the final exam, even then it was only one paper she returned. Students were blind when it came to their grade.
Schneider is very nice, but talks about herself too much. Didn't learn anything new, so take somebody else.
Professor Schneider is nice, but I did not learn anything new from taking her course. She does talk about herself quite often, which cuts into class time. The class was easy, but I felt like I wasted a lot of money. I would recommend taking another professor, simply bc I didn't gain anything from her.","Professor Schneider is nice, but I did not learn anything new from taking her course.

295,"Do not take this professor, avoid him like the plague. He grades insanely tough and even if you get a problem right you could still get it wrong b/c you didn't do it exactly how he wanted it. He offers little/no help over the course and spends a lot of the class not teaching MTH 302 he spends that time teaching stuff that have already been taken.
so so bad. I learned absolutely nothing from him. He is difficult to follow and will mark you wrong for a correct answer if you do not do it the way he wants
Don't ever take his class. No matter how hard you try you'll still be wrong. I went to office hours just to come out with more questions. I went to tutoring centers to get more help, he still says I'm wrong. He asks to show work on things that are difficult to show work for. If it's not to his liking, forget it. 
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM. This is the worst professor at gvsu. Lectures are confusing and he makes everything more difficult than it has to be. It is like he is trying to get us to fail. This professor IS NOT setting ANYONE up for success. He should not be a professor and should be fired.
the tests and quizzes were graded hard. How every, he's very lenient on his grading scale. We had 2 exam and then the final and were allowed to drop one. Very helpful. He's very understanding. He doesn't give homework but does assign practice problems for extra credit. DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS, I could've gotten a better grade if I did.
This is hands down one of the worst educators I have ever had. I am naturally good at math and science and I had a C+ in the class. I was extremely disappointed with his teaching abilities. He doesnt care if you get the answer right, if he doesnt like the way you did a problem, he will still mark you wrong. Do not take his classes.
Worst teacher ever. Dont know how he is a professor
Does not do a good job of explaining material to his students. He rambles on about things we did in a previous class. Its basically a class where you have to teach yourself. He does give out bonus points but they do not equal the amount you get wrong on assignments due to him grading so heavy. If you dont do it his way, good luck. Dont take!!!!
Prof Haidar expects a lot of work out of his students but it's understandable for a tough concept like differential equations. He grades hard but he curves hard as well on exams. His class policies were great in making a tough course workable. ALWAYS PARTICIPATE IN CLASS FOR BONUS POINTS.
Rambles off onto random topics during lecture, extremely complicated tests. You have to teach yourself Trigonometry pretty much. Expect him to accuse you of cheating, and don't expect to ever hear back from him in emails. His study guides and answer keys for exams consist of page numbers and references to lectures, doesn't actually explain anything
Professor Haidar offers plenty of chances to earn bonus points on the homework and grades with a heavy curve. I was wary of taking his class at first because of the other ratings, but he was one of the best professors I've ever had. He gives plenty of time for questions in class and offers a mix of in person and take home exams.
At first, I was afraid to take his class because of his rating. He's a really nice guy and he seems like he genuinely cares. Here's advice from me, someone that doesn't do well in math usually (Calc 1  C+, Cal 2  B-, Calc 3  C) DON'T take him. I had a really hard time learning from him. He also doesn't respond to emails very well.
Overall you could tell he cared about his students, but he was very strict about when we could ask questions, and got in 2 arguments with 2 different people in my class about that. To me kind of comes off as rude. Very tough grader, but there are a lot of opportunities for bonus points on the homework.
DO NOT TAKE CLASS. This prof doesnt know how to teach and its so hard to understand him. He will teach a level one question and then ask a level 10 question on the exam. Wont answer questions in class. Ive always gotten As in math classes and this one seemed impossible.
Care about your GPA? Don't take professor Haidar's class. He grades awfully, it is his way or the highway. There were many occasions where I or my peers would get a correct answer and show work, but he didn't like it, so he marked it wrong. He knows the material, just doesn't know how to teach or communicate concepts to the students.
For MTH 123, it is a level 100 class but it feels as if it is a level 300 class. His grading is ridiculous. If you dont do it specifically right the whole problem is wrong. You can tell its super hard considering a 58 percent in his class is a C. I DO NOT recommend taking him. It would be wise to take another trig professor
Tries to come off as lighthearted and funny, but is anything but. Makes material harder than it needs to be, because he's disorganized and rude when asked questions. Made three people cry in my class. Thinks his time is more important than yours. Do not take this professor.
Absolutely wonderful teacher. Truly cares about his students success. Difficult, but thorough. Curves are usually significant!
Professor Haidar is chooses to play a guessing game rather than teaching. He will put a problem on the board that you have never seen before and that you were never taught and would be asked to solve it. Would not recommend or take again. Very very heavy curve on all exams including the final.
Pro: -Leaves work on board -HEAVY CURVE Con: -Asks to solve a problem you've never seen before, spend 45 min on it, only to say question is ""bogus"" in the end -Each test has a 4 pg essay (Can't keep test) -Partial Credit. What is it? -Final unpassable, includes topics only in book -First grade submitted 1 week before final(ask prior, you're ""good"")","Care about your GPA? Don't take professor Haidar's class.

296,"This class was very difficult, and the professor was not the best at teaching the material in an understandable way. Be prepared to teach yourself everything. We had few actual lectures, just activities we had to work through ourselves to learn the ideas. The course was ""ungraded"" so your grade only depends on a final portfolio due at the end.
He means well and really wants you to learn but he cant properly teach the material, you have to learn outside of class, but he expects too much background knowledge and presumes all his students are math majors with knowledge and skill in software and concepts that he takes for granted. Non-math majors would NOT pass this class. Withdrew
He means well, but his classes are all over the place. As long as you complete your portfolio and do any work he asks you to do, you will easily pass. Overall he is a great guy, but his teaching style is hard.
Clark was honestly the worst professor I've ever had at GVSU. He was not helpful at all, and would make you feel like an idiot if you asked any questions. On multiple occasions he told my friend to get tested for a learning disability. Literally, if you can take ANYONE else, avoid him at all costs.
I had to drop of out this class. He never gave any examples, never gave us extra material to help us understand concepts. He didn't explain things very well. If you didn't go to any of his lectures, you'd have to watch the recording, but it didn't help at all. He grades a portfolio on a program he didn't show us how to use. Take someone else.
All English Literature and Linguistics students should take this course. Yes, it's a math class, but its focus (cryptography) gives a look into language from a different perspective. Wells' teaching style walks you through some difficult problems; he is always available for help. Just don't jump into this course without reviewing old math skills.
His teaching is subpar; but I enjoyed the portfolio method of grading. It took the emphasis off of memorization and turned it onto learning. That being said, actual learning can be difficult with his lecturing style, but he will always clarify and meet during office hours to help.
Professor Wells is average. The classes are all lectures and the grades come from the work done outside of class. Homework is about 5-10 hours a week. He mixes up his vocabulary sometimes which may confuse you. Each portfolio meeting determines your grade but the final meeting grade on that is all that matters. Focus on the portfolio.
This professor is not good at explaining concepts. If anything, his explanations left students more confused than they were originally. Some days he gave handouts that were not very informative, and other days students watched as he typed problems into a math program and didn't explain what he was doing.
Dr. Wells' class had extremely inconsistent structure. Some days we were given handouts to work through and other days we stared at him running Maple code all class. Your entire grade depends on a portfolio at the end of the semester and to get an A you have to do your own project outside of class. The grading to me feels extremely subjective.
Super nice guy and wants you to do well. However, his class structure is awful. You will be graded over one paper for the entire year. He gives no homework so you never understand the algebra involved and forget what he taught in lecture. Do not take this class if you plan on taking higher math courses!
Dr. Wells is a pretty awesome dude. He is a very smart professor, funny and quirky, and dedicated to teaching. He tells you everything you will learn at the beginning of the semester, and by the end you just have to prove you've learned it with a portfolio of work. I'm not normally good at math, but Dr. Wells made it enjoyable and I learned a ton.
Great Prof. The man's got style and flair. Class entirely based of a semester long Portfolio, that is supposed to show mastery of course learning goals out lined in the syllabus. He knows his material and answers questions by asking follow up questions. Some people hate that but if you are studying math you should be used to it. Would recommend.  
The entire class is based on proof's so you can imagine it's not very fun. You are graded entirely on your portfolio that you build throughout the year and that he helps you correct along the way. If you read the book a little and put in work early in the semester it's not that bad. He is better than the other 210 Prof's though. Take him for 210! 
He is helpful IF you go in and tell him what you need help with and where you are at with a problem. If you go in for office hours and just say I don't know how to do this, be prepared for him to get frustrated with you. You need to put effort in and he will gladly help. His lectures are all over though.. Very confusing lectures. I didn't go often.
No help. Lectures are boring and useless. Worst class I've ever taken, and I'm a math major.
Does not help at all even if you go to office hours...
If you are looking for a normal math class, this is not what you want. He wants you to explain everything you are doing and if you do not he will not give you a good score. He grades in numbers and not letters, you have to show mastery on the math targets which in most cases means you have to write a paragraph on every answer. Never know your grade
Wells is a fantastic professor! He really knows his stuff, and will answer any and all of your questions. He will take time out of his day to look up your questions and present it at the next class meeting. His tests are fair and there really isn't much homework. He is now one of my favourite professors!
This professor is very approachable, and in order to do well in this class you must come to his office hours and discuss proofs with him multiple times per week.  Otherwise your effort in this class will be meaningless.  His expectations are very high for the final portfolio. Grade is based on proofs almost entirely.Okay professor, difficult class.",Professor Wells is average. The classes are all lectures and the grades come from the work done outside of class.

298,"Her lectures are certainly not boring and she very much knows what she's talking about. Before her class I was only mildly interested in Anthro but now I'm minoring in it. She uses PowerPoints a lot but her lectures are good and she chooses great books. I can't stand group assignments and these were actually nice! The exams are all multiple choice.
Lectures were boring and she never varied from the powerpoint presentations. I often got the feeling that she didn't know what she was talking about despite her degrees in the field. She was difficult to follow in lecture, but outside the classroom she was in her element. I found her a better teacher in her office than in the classroom.
I took the honors section. A lot of writing is expected, but in my opinion she's not a very critical reader if you provide detail. Her lectures are super boring, and the readings can be boring too. But if you go to class and write the few 3 pg papers throughout the semester, it is such an easy A.
Prof used to teach this class as a 405 and the requirements for new 210 are definitely above a 200-lvl but if you follow directions and give yourself time to complete assignments, they are fairly easy. I'll likely get an A and it wasn't terribly time-consuming. Prof is very nice and helpful as well, good sense of humor.
Prof. Hull has a unique way of teaching anthropology and although many find it boring, I found the class insanely interesting. The short reads are really good but the Robins text is hard to stay awake while reading (and I love reading). Do all of the assignments and show up on time. She will roll her eyes at you or call you out if you walk in late.
Nice teacher. Easy class. A lot of reading and powerpoints and papers. She grades the papers critically. Overall a good professor unfortunately I missd a few deadlines on some papers and as a result I got a C+ instead of the B I should have gotten. Overall excellent professor with a lot of knowledge and experience in her field.
She talked a lot about her own experiences and a lot of the test questions were about lecture, but if you don't read the textbook youll have problems. I got a B and i like half read the assigned readings...
She is such a nice person. You can tell she loves the topic, and really likes teaching too. The class is quite easy, although I know some people who struggled with her exams (I don't know how though). I would recommend her.
She's a very nice lady, but the class is terribly boring. Read the books and you'll be fine for the tests. Uses power points a lot, and her lectures are usually very boring. Videos are usually entertaining because of how ridiculous they are.
Professor Hull was good. Even though the subject tends to get boring and I knew nothing about anthropology going into the class but she tells you exactly what she expects on the quizzes and 3 small paper assignments were pretty easy. I ended up with an A- I would definitely recommend her.
A nice woman, but the class was horrendously boring. She had interesting stories from her time in Mexico but that's pretty much it. Info from lecture was barely applied which made having to sit through it that much worse. The essay exams are easy and if you read the books the final is easy as well.
This class was really boring, but she took attendance everyday, 3 exams, the final was take home.  lots of discussion.  If you read the books you should do fine in the class.
HNR section. A nice lady, but not a super prof. Cares about her students, but I wasn't impressed with the class. Ppt. lectures, talks a lot, little discussion, big group project and 3 at home essay tests (fine if you use the readings). Got an A, but grading was a bit iffy at times. I'll admit that anthro isn't my thing, though.
Hull is not a good prof. This class is only for individuals who are thinking about majoring in anthropology.Three exams which were horrible+ a 20 minute presentation made for a miserable semester. Avoid
Boring class but good professor. Its easy to get an A if you just come to class and study for the tests.
Had her for honors section. She is so cute and super helpful.  Her eagerness makes me smile. Lots of small papers and three average sized ones.
Incredibly helpful.  When informants backed out last minute, helped to come up with a new approach/topic within the study and offered to give more time past the semester deadline if project couldn't be completed.  I've had her for 4 classes and she's always been super nice in all of them.  Wonderful professor if you're willing to do the work.
Incredible amount of material to cover - lots of weekly readings and assignments on top of the three major monograph books.  Major assignments easy overall.  Three weeks given for final paper was nice - the paper itself was tedious.
I got a B and I did nothing. I spent around 200 bucks on her 3 textbooks. Easy grader. Hard tests. Take home quizes, all but one. NO take home tests. Thats a rip that she allows that in one of her classes but not 204. nice prof. BORING!!!!!!!
Weekly article reviews were tedious but not too hard.  Tests were difficult but take home and plenty of time was given to complete.  Theories studied were sometimes hard to understand - she sometimes wasn't even sure of the differences herself but went by what the book said.  Grading was pretty easy, though.","She's a very nice lady, but the class is terribly boring. Read the books and you'll be fine for the tests.

300,"Sometimes it gets hard to follow lectures because she reads from her paper notes instead of making slides so you have to write really fast. The assignments in this class are easy and quick. If you do the required readings, you will be fine.
Yan is honestly one of the sweetest profs I've ever had. I'm a conservative business major male and I appreciated this class a lot. Yan is so knowledgable and funny and she grades super well and reasonable. You don't need a book, just prepare to read interesting scholarly articles. Final paper is a breeze after reading so many :). Thanks Yan!
Had her a couple semesters ago, such a nice/sweet lady. Don't need the textbook but need to read articles for short weekly papers you write. Tells you what short answer questions could be on the exam, everything basically comes from lectures. If you put in effort you will do very well but you do have to write a lot which can get old
Prof Yu is so sweet & likes to connect with her students. She likes for her students to participate & share their experiences relating to the class materials. The textbook homework is easy. A few reading responses & take home exercises. she is very clear ab what is on exams & both were taken online. such a kind woman who really loves her job
You cover so much each class, we were all scrambling taking notes. Tests very detailed questions straight from lecture. But her study guides were very detailed. She let us take our exams at home thankfully or I would have done way worse on them. She's super funny, I would not take this class online because that would be boring- take in person.
shes such a sweetheart and youll love her if you have a soul. but she gets off topic a lot, which we love her for.
Professor Yu is a goofy professor. The material was straightforward and easy to learn. She tends to ramble in lectures and wasted class time. She was very understanding and always offered her help!
This professor is my favorite professor I have had. She is so sweet and funny and even though she gets off topic, it does always loop back to the material we are discussing in class. Her assignments are really straight forward and as long as you do your work and read the book, you will be fine. Highly recommend.
I liked Yan! This class was pretty easy, but she wasnt super clear on what we needed to know for quizzes and exams. Stick to the lecture videos, read the chapters, and do the assignments and youll do fine!
Took class in Fall 2020. She has long lectures but cares about what she is teaching. She gives a decent amount of work but always gives you time to complete each assignment with spread out due dates. One quiz and little writing assignment due each week, but easy if you listen to her lecture. she also makes material very easy to understand.
She was very clear about what she wanted. The quizzes were almost too easy and she always hints about whats going to be on there. The take home exercises and reading take 20 minutes if you know what youre doing. I word of advice: go over the quizzes for the exam because almost all the questions are from them. Very easy, I loved having her
She is a good professor but gives way too many reading responses/ take home assignments/ exams. There is usually an exam every week and either a reading response or a take home assignment which results in lots of work if you're also reading the textbook chapter that goes along with the class. (Which I suggest you do).
Professor Yu is such a sweet lady! There are 8 quizzes based off of the readings, 2 exams, and 6 reading responses. If you read the chapters, this class is very easy. The content is very interesting too. She makes the class really enjoyable. She does have an accent, but it is not hard to understand her. Also, participation is strongly encouraged!
Professor Yu is really nice. She sometimes rambles and gets off topic, but usually its still mostly relevant, and gives real world context to the lessons. She is also learning a lot about gender and sexuality topics. I heard some stories about her tact with regards to gender and sexuality topics but shes definitely a lot better now! I liked her.
Quizzes every week but she gives you reading questions that are basically the quiz. If you email those to her she will fix them and add more to what your answers are. That helped me greatly in studying for the quizzes. 6 Reading Responses that aren't too difficult. Lots of in class exercises so don't skip a lot! Fairly easy class overall!
I think that Yan Yu is an amazing lady but I felt that her course was harder then the previous reviews had me expecting you have a quiz every week that is directly from the book. So if you dont like reading I wouldnt recommend but I absolutely love Yan as a person
Easy Grader
I think if you put in the effort, you can easily get an A. Class is mainly taught from a bunch of articles. It's an SWS class, so it is writing heavy but she is pretty easy about her grading. She talks a lot and drags out discussion but its fine. There are in class participation points so don't skip too many classes. She is a very sweet prof!
Professor Yu is a gentle and kind professor. She has her funny moments because she is Chinese, so when we're talking about American traditions or practices (ones she hasn't heard of) it can make for a good laugh in class. Do your reading, they aren't hard, and they're quite eye-opening as well! Great class!
Makes the class harder than it needs to be. Graded almost fully on pre quizzes I wouldn't take this unless you need to.",Prof Yu is so sweet & likes to connect with her students. She likes for her students to participate & share their experiences relating to the class materials. The textbook homework is easy. A few reading responses & take home exercises. she is very clear ab what is on exams & both were taken online. such a kind woman who really loves her job

This man hated teaching and wasn't afraid to tell people.  He only cared about publishing.  Thank the Lord he's gone!
He was OK, not close to the best I ever had...
This man was awesome!   If you dinked around, slept or just asked questions about something he answered 5 minutes ago (and you missed cause you were talking to someone) then you deserved his very dry sense of humor/attack. He will be missed!
He seems better in retirement
I disliked him so much, I'll rate his sorry arse again! Good riddance!
Thank you Retirement!
Hmm.. I can honestly say I didn't learn a thing in that class
I thought he was a nice guy, maybe because he's retiring? ;)
taught what I needed to know for a career
Aww common people! This was the easiest A I ever got.
Take notes!
BOOOORING. Class lectures are a joke. Tons of memorization from book.
I tried talking to him several times, thank god I will get a new advisor
Excellent teacher.  He DOES prepare students for the real world.
easier than the other CS350 sections.  Not the best prof, but not the worst.
Bad thats all i can say
Boring, no tact, Insane memorization for tests, not even subpar in any category.
This man should not be allowed to teach.  Way too critical and aggressive.",This man should not be allowed to teach.  Way too critical and aggressive.
303,"good professor. the exams are based off the textbook which is a little mundane. she funny. 
tuesdays were lecture heavy and then every thursday we had 25 min to prepare a group presentation and had to present a 5 min presentation. 
i didnt mind, the presentations are interesting-- but if you dont like public speaking maybe steer clear. 
Your typical GVSU accounting lecture, pretty boring. But, I did really like the group presentations every week because it helped me apply what I learned to real life. The exams were more difficult than they needed to be. Overall not awful but not amazing
Prof is super nice but not a good teacher. Lectures are just reading from the slides (boring) and impromptu group projects every week. Exams are tough and not well written. However her grading isn't the worst I've seen. Good luck trying to get an A 
Easy summer asynch class. Easy hw and I found the handouts very helpful for studying. Tests were fairly short and not overly difficult but helpful.
Material really wasn't that hard and you get a notecard for the exams but she wasn't a great teacher. Did not learn much from her; had to learn it all on my own. She's bareable.
Every week of class is a lecture then group activity, her lectures she goes off her PowerPoints she makes so often going to class is not necessary. For an SWS class it is very light on writing and she is an easy grader. Exams are very tough
Dori is very smart and knows accounting. However, we are an entry level class and she acted like we knew what she meant. I did take her as a 6-9 and she never would let us out early even if we had the homework done. Gets annoyed when we ask for help. Exams are tough but so is everything else. Worst professor in Seidman college I've had.
I like Dori as a person. As a professor for acc212, i would not recommend. She usually teaches higher level acc classes and I've learned that in 212. She flies through material thinking we know what she's talking about. The group assignments and quizzes are only worth 2.5 points, exams are impossible. Basically only pts are tests, good luck w those
Acc 310 is a very hard class and Danko knows that as she gives you many handouts to help with the content. This class is light on homework but in order to good on exams you need to study and practice a lot otherwise this class is impossible
GREAT professor for intermediate 1. She provides handouts and  worksheets that simplify and condense the material - which is important because its a LOT to cover in one semester. She is also very specific about what you should study and hosts a review  session online Sunday before exams. The material is tough, but Dori makes it a little easier!
Her exams are impossible and have nothing to do with the homework. She also told us the wrong date for the final and emailed everyone the night of to say she changed the date. I would avoid this teacher and try to take it through someone else because she is just horrible. Which at this point seems to be a common trend at Grand Valley.
Exams were way too hard; she gives you no resources or tips to study for them. Didn't seem to put much effort into the class. Didn't even tell us when the final was for our class until finals week. If you can, try taking this class with another prof.
Exams were impossible and her communication of exam dates and content was poor. Assignments are easy and the material seems easy until you take the exams.
This was Dori's first semester teaching 310, and we had lots of issues with our exams. Exams alone make up 60% of your grade. You really have to put in effort and time if you want to pass this class. She was confusing most of the time, and I felt I could've done better in this class with a different prof. She's nice, but this class is difficult.
310 isn't fun with whoever you take it with. It was Dori's first time teaching the class, so there were certainly some rough patches along the way. The exams weren't impossible, but she didn't give us much of a study guide to go off of. Just some practice exams. Overall, she wasn't too bad. She does want to help you, which counts for something.
Dori is a great prof. This was her first time teaching 310, so she is still getting the hang of it. With that, she would curve the exams by a lot. She has handouts and lectures for every lecture. For each chapter, there's a quiz and homework assignment. 3 exams in total. She tells you what written problems will be on exam. She is easy to talk to.
Dori was an amazing professor. She really knows accounting. Accounting is a hard class in general but she made it seem a little easier. She also gives up to 36 points of extra credit if you do all of the homework and show up to class every day. It's a lot of work but she's very helpful.
Great prof, very caring and nice as a person but had some weak points in her teaching skills. Was always upbeat and lectures were never boring. She is excellent in explaining things but goes through information very fast so always ask for another example or for her to slow down and she will.
Dori is a very nice lady. She is a very skilled accountant, and it shows. I had her MWF. She lectured on MW and then gave us a group activity on Friday. She always helps you and your group with it to make sure that you get the full points. Tests are always on Monday. 1 point quiz at the end of each class. LOTS of connect HW and quizzes. Very clear.
Dori is not the best professor. She rushes through the material so fast and the study guides are nothing like the exams.","Great prof, very caring and nice as a person but had some weak points in her teaching skills.

309,"Prof Leidig wants everyone to answer questions to earn a decent grade, but you better know what you're answering or else. There apparently is not a right/wrong answer. Great class that made me want to learn more about what I need to know in my job.
He talks about working in tech the way it was 20 years ago. This guy has been away from the industry (has he ever been in the industry?) for far too long to be teaching this class.
Leidig is the director of the School of CIS. Should be focused on the future, but all of his lectures are ""back in my day"" stories. Class covers dull tech legal history. Don't expect much out of the discussions, because he'll immediately cut you off before you can explain your argument.
Doesn't know the material. Should really be teaching business courses, not CS.
Dr Leidig's class was really enjoyable and very different. We read two novels about IT managers to show what it is like in IT departments. Then in class we talk about what lessons can be learned from the cases, Leidig has years of experience and shares examples. Engage with him in class and give your opinion, you will get a higher grade.
Leidig has many years of IT management experience, and brings a lot of interesting stories to explain what is happening in IT today. Very interesting topics. I heard I wouldn't like the class because the exams were extreme, but the midterm wasn't that bad, and the class really makes me think about my career in IT. I like the novels used in class
Very different class style then all the others in CIS.  I really liked the open discussions trying to get us to see different view points and issues with current IT decisions.  Very good class.  Prof Leidig knows a lot about the IT field.
I didn't really get the point of the class. Anyone can pass even if they fail both tests, not very challenging. Open book tests but that really doesn't matter because you won't finish it. The exams are graded on how much you can type not if the answers are ""correct"". He's an alright prof...
I really like the way Dr. Leidig tries to get everyone to give their opinion.  Then he goes on to show why things are happening in the IT industry and how it relates to us.  Great prof and very knowledgeable and interesting.
Dr. Leidig is very good at doing one thing: waking you up to the realities of the IT industry and the problems it has. That's the entire point of this class - to get you to adequately answer the ""So what, who cares"" question. He never uses the textbook. The more you add to the in-class discussion, the higher grade you will get.
Leidig has a lot of computer industry knowledge to share. Basically take notes of everything he says in class and be sure to  speak up in class.  Those who talk get better grades.  Killer essay exams.
His class was a lot of work but made me learn a lot outside of the normal work.  He has a lot of work experience and brings that to class.  Lectures are really long discussions about current events and computer history.  The class was one of the best in CIS.
I heard I wouldn't enjoy this class, but it was one of the best I had.  Leidig really got me to think about what is happening in the IT jobs.  Very good class and instructor.
Very interesting class, with random discussions about current IT tech trends.  Lectures (actually not lectures) were about IT news, but exams were on the book which you needed to read.  Overall it was a good class because of how much knowledge Leidig brings in from his career.
He is the department chair, and he'll be happy to tell you about it.  He asks for class discussions, yet he tends to belittle opinions that do not coincide with his own.  His exams test how fast students can type, rather than what they've learned.
Very interesting discussions.  Basically uses organized tangents to tie current events in IT to textbook concepts.  Great class.
Leidig takes current events to teach how to technology applies to business.  His sharing of his years of IT experience and knowledge is what you are really expected to learn.  The book is only for background reading.  Good class and great prof.
Leidig is a great prof with tons of experience and knowledge.  Get used to his method of discussions and answer the essay exams just like class and you'll do fine.  This was the best class in the IS program because of how he ties everything together.
This guy is the head of the computing program, and it shows why.  He really knows a LOT about the IT industry and what we need to know in our jobs.  The book is only used as extra reading cause the real material is in his analysis of current events.  That is what he really tests on.  Great Prof and great class.
I was lucky to get Dr. Leidig as a teacher and the longer I continue, the more I appreciate him.  He was sincere and very engaged in our learning.  I will well use the concepts he taught and be able to manage IT resources well.","Dr Leidig's class was really enjoyable and very different.

310,"Work load was a little heavy but her homework activities are pretty easy. As long as you participate and do the homework you can easily keep a 100% until turning the portfolio in. Great professor, she pushes you to do your best and genuinely really cares about your success. Very accessible, nice, and extremely supportive to all her students. 
She was an amazing teacher, there were 3 papers due the whole class and some weekly assignments each week. She was a very flexible grader and gave good feedback for every assignment. Be ready to show up because attendance and participation is a part of the final grade. Overall she was a super easy going teacher who cared for her students,easy class
I really like professor White. She is very nice and cares about her students. The papers can be a lot to write and revise multiple times, but she makes it very manageable! The activities online are fairly easy and quick. She gives great feedback and wants to see you succeed. The grading criteria is very clear and straightforward
She's very nice and cares about students success. Gives good feedback on papers and doesn't over work you with assignments.
I would never take her class again. Lowkey being mean towards me because I'm able to speak multiple languages and she says something about I should see writing consultant because of my background?! I'm not sure what exactly is she trying to say but it wasn't nice.
The nicest professor at GVSU, no doubt. She is a great professor and person, she really cares about all of her students and wants you to feel comfortable. Unfortunately, the portfolio will make or break your final grade, do NOT underestimate it (no matter which WRT150 prof you have).
she is very helpful and kind. she will make sure you pass your portfolio grade
Professor White is great. She could make you feel like you're not a good writer, but don't give up. Keep working on your papers with the writing consultants and ask Professor White to read it. She does give good feedback for the final portfolio. Overall, you have to work super hard for this class to receive an A.
Professor White structures her classes in a fashion which equally disperses student workload across the semester, which helps a lot when finals week approaches. In general, Professor white offers many opportunities in and out of class from herself and writing consultants to help with writing papers for the class, and just writing in general.
I strongly appreciate White as a prof before entering WRT 150. Since she teaches both classes, she's always open to share advice & help students prepare for 150 without surprises. Her 098 is still not exactly a ""blow-off"" class because she grades somewhat intensely on essays but all feedback is helpful and you WILL learn how to be a better writer!
LOVED this prof. Take her. You won't be disappointed.
She's great! I would take her again for sure! She's amazing!
Professor White was my absolute favorite professor. She wasvery willing to help and clearly cares about her students. She also gave us lots of time in lab to work on our paper revisions when she could help us. I tried to get her for creative writing but she doesn't teach that class. By far one of the best profs I have had at GV.
LOVE PROFESSOR WHITE. Writing 150 is a hard class in general because you are only graded on 3-4 papers, but Professor White gives you all the necessary tools to be successful in this class. She gives great feedback and is VERY willing to work with you to get you to where you want to be. Everything she teaches you has a purpose. She is THE BEST.
Great prof at GV. Very helpful and warm. Take her. You won't be disappointed.
Prof. White was super sweet and gave great feedback; but she treats you like a child, gives no time to work in lab, and assigns pointless ready that takes up unnecessary time.
Gives good feedback. You really have to read up on the syllabus or you will fall behind on the essays. Professor White is one of the most lenient teachers on campus and she is really dedicated to her students. Just show the effort and drive and shell be willing to help out in anyway she can.
Professor White was very kind. Theres a lot of rewriting and extra things we had to do with each papers we had to write. First half of the class was always spent talking about things I personally found irrelevant. Gives minimal time to do peer editing which stinks because I found the peer edits to be very affective. Cant miss over 4 days.
LOVED PROFESSOR WHITE! You may not have tons of time to work on papers in class, but most of the things we learned in class were very valuable into making an A portfolio. She gave great feedback and using that and some things we learned in class, I did well! Definitely take her if writing isnt your strong suit,like me, as she will be a great help!
Treats students like high schoolers in terms of teaching but grades difficultly","I really like professor White. She is very nice and cares about her students.

311,"While extremely knowledgeable, Bacino lacks the ability to stay organized throughout the lectures and often strays weeks off the syllabus. Keep up with the reading and be organized. I recommend the use of a power point to guide his lectures and additional maps to clarify material.
LOVED him! I am an el. ed. teacher,  now and whenever I talk about S.S. I bring up this professor and how he made learning names and dates fun and real.  I never cared much for history until Prof. Bacino-Thank you for being an inspiration!
Very cool, and laidback.  Informative and easy to understand.
Crazy man!  I loved his class.  He was so much fun to listen to.
The class is easy.  Take good notes and will have no problem with the TAKE HOME tests.
Leo's cool. If you have him read your papers b/f you hand them in, he'll bump up your grade. 3 essays for a final grade. but they're easy to write on. talk in class and your grade will be higher. =)
I disagree with everyone, if you are not good history he is not a very good prof.  If you understand history this class will be a breeze.
Sweet Prof. It's fun and he does some crazy things.  Good class take it if you can.
The coolest teacher fun class
BIG DOG Leo...The man is a legend!!  Take home exams are a breeze and you get to listen to his impersonations of people in history all the time.  He likes the Simpsons and South Park too. Not the normal HST prof and thank God for that.  I repeat...LEGEND!
He is really helpful and you have take home tests.
Good Prof.  Show up to class, take good notes and you WILL get an A.
Great guy, love the class. Highly recomend.
Fun Italian man...makes lectures as fun as they can get, I guess.  Take home tests...if you miss less than 2 classes, you don't have to take the final!  Overall, a pretty good prof!
Adds interest to a boring subject w/his godfather-like accent and crazy comments.  Tends to ramble on and on at times.
VERY BORING, TALKS IN CIRCLES, SAYS  YA  A LOT, TEST ARE EASY
All the men love him and all the women want to be his friend.The greatest ever.A credit to the Italian American race.","Fun Italian man...makes lectures as fun as they can get, I guess.

314,"Paul is a professor that genuinely loves his class and students. If you're willing to open up, he is extremely helpful! Participation goes a long way for him and he creates a safe/comfortable space to do so. The work isn't too tedious and it can be fun! The purpose of the class can be confusing at first, but this isn't a traditional art class.
At the beginning of the year he seemed a little disorganized, I wasnt really sure when things were due and that we he used google drive to turn things in instead of blackboard. But as the year went on that got better. He also students  them to try new ways of doing things. Probably not the best professor, and not the worse either.
100% regret taking this class. Paul was rude and exceedingly dismissive, and while his instructions were incredibly vague, he somehow still had very specific ideas in mind of what he wanted. He talks a big game yet never seems able to form a coherent concept.
I took a few classes with Paul, and he's one of my favorite professors I've ever had. The comments on here about him being vague with criteria for projects are true, but to be honest I think that might just be inescapable with the conceptual and theoretical aspects of the class. He's one of those profs whose style you either click with or don't.
Paul is an interesting dude. One second he is complimenting you and giving good feedback, and the next second he is being unclear in the directions, and tearing your project apart. By the end of the class you end up learning a lot without even realizing it, and producing really good work, but you'll probably pull your hair out and curse his name!!
DON'T TAKE AS A GEN ED FOR ART. This class only makes sense for art majors, I'm serious. SO many non-art majors in my class struggled. But hes a great guy and I found the class pretty easy. You need to do the outside work or you will be behind. If you do what he says in critiques its an easy A. No ""free"" absences, you gotta go to class.
Hands down the worst professor I've ever had. He talks a big game and tries to sound smart by using a lot of random vocabulary but it just makes him sound like a jerk. He is so abstract and the criteria of the class is so unclear so you never know what you're doing. He is not willing to help his students, and just belittles you when you ask! 0/10
An art class but do not expect to get any of your projects even close to done in class. The class is confusing to understand. I did not even understand the main concept of the course until the last week of class and so didn't my classmates. I would never take this class if you are not an art major. Terrible choice for a gen ed art class .
Paul is the friendliest prof Ive ever had. Hes super approachable, doesnt get upset with his students when they can't do what's asked of them, and instead chats with them on the side to make sure theyre doing okay. My only complaint is that hes super vague about what he expects from you for each project, but its hard to be specific in art classes.
Paul is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. He truly cares about his students and allows so much freedom. Pushes you to be a better artist. Would definitely take again
Paul's by far one of my favorite professors; his passion for art is truly motivating and he is inspiring only if you care to decipher art and the philosophy behind it. He's vague on what is expected out of projects simply because he wants us to think for ourselves and find our own process in art. But once you get to know him, it's an easy A.
paul gives little to no instructions on any of his random projects, he never gives due dates until the class before. Super unorganized and I spent an entire semester completely lost as to what was going on. Also, he grades based on his opinion of your work, not any specific criteria
One thing you have to understand before you take paul's class- especially CPS- he gives you freedom to figure out your own path. He gives unspecific critiques because he doesn't want to pigeon-hole people into his way of thinking. If you pay attention in class, and like to be stretched at to think for yourself, he is amazing.
Paul is a super nice guy but you can't understand him. He doesn't clarify the projects. I took this cause I had to for foundations and I would NEVER do it again. You basically just do random stuff. You jump from project to project, sometimes 3 at a time and your always confused. He's crazy with the way he only cares about that class no other one.
Paul is a really fun guy, and he's great to get along with, but the class has a lot of work to stay on top of. He talks a lot and it's usually not very interesting, I zoned out a lot. He gives you a lot of assignments and little to no directions on what to be doing.
Paul is HILARIOUS! but his teaching could do some work... He is an amazing person but isn't very clear when describing the projects and giving you help..
paul knows a lot about art but is so completely indecisive in expectations, organization, and just about everything you want a professor for.  he will not lead you to bettering yourself.  I've never felt so empty about art until his class. if you are taking him for cps know this is a weeding out class but it will also destroy your love of art.
Paul is a pretty nutty guy, but his class discussions are funny; they're pretty long but still remarkably hilarious.  He is not very clear with instructions, so get the number of a classmate or two to help keep track of everything and get 2nd opinions.  He uses the Wiki heavily and that will be the basis of the info you get for projects.
Group crits are a useless waste of time. Individual crits are almost as big of a waste of time. He likes projects to be done his way, his style. And the wiki will dominate your life.
I had Paul for Civic Studio. He is not always clear or easy to understand- but sometimes the things that come out of his mouth are really funny and random and make the class enjoyable. You will learn things about yourself and about the art world from this class. Warning: Paul will email you.. A LOT.","Paul is an interesting dude.

315,"Dr. Hunt is incredibly kind and passionate about what she teaches. However, I would not take her again. Not once this semester did she post an exam or quiz when she said she was going to. Though she is a great professor, she has caused me so much stress in not posting things so I had to plan my schedule around her disorganization multiple times. 
Dr. Hunt is amazing, she truly cares about her students. She is very understanding of how much is going on in our lives. The class environment is great. Only gave quizzes/tests for grades but they were all open note and online. The tests/quizzes could be difficult but with the open note rule it was understandable. Overall a really great class. 
Dr. Hunt is a great and passionate professor. The only grades in the class are tests and quizzes but they are open note, online, and can be taken from anywhere. Due to this, she does try to make you think by them, but they still are not very hard and automatically adds a point of E.C. She is encouraging and wants the best for her students. 
Dr. Hunt was always energetic. She is great at talking about the notes and it is obvious she knows what she is talking about. She also has lots of personal stories that connect with what we were learning. She truly cares for her students. 
So funny. Lectures are entertaining whish makes it more fun to come to class. She's very understanding and super sweet, if you ever need anything just email her and she'll probably sign it with emojis
Hunt is a hilarious professor! Her lectures are always super interesting and she uses lots of great examples. The ideas being taught are pretty easy, but her tests are pretty difficult. The questions really make you think but she encourages everyone to use their notes. Take your time on the tests and honestly, you'll be fine!
Hunt is an amazing person and is hilarious. She tries to keep everyone engaged and you can tell she loves what she does. With that said, this class is not easy. You will work your butt off to maintain a good grade and that still isn't enough sometimes. Her exams are super conceptual and HARD. Take Hunt but be ready to work!
Jodee is enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and so funny. She is a wonderful lady. But her exams? So tough! The reading assignments are absolutely necessary. I cannot imagine having taken this class before COVID... She used to only allow students one page of notes on exams. She also didn't provide her lecture notes before 2020. I struggled for that A.
I absolutely ADORED Prof. Hunt. Her lectures were so interesting and I actually was interested in stuff I usually don't care about. Her passion for the subject is apparent and her energy is honestly infectious. At least for this year, all of the tests were online and open note with around 48 hours to take each one. TAKE GOOD NOTES!!!!!
Her test were extremely hard in my opinion. The test are written with multiple correct answers but one is more correct than the rest. If you are good at catching those fine details great. If not take another teacher. Why try to trick people arent the main details more important?
She really cares about students and is very understanding. Quizzes and exams are only points and can be pretty tricky. All were online. She types out notes for lectures and chapters which is helpful.
Professor Hunt was a really amazing professor, Her exams are fair and if you are succeeding in her course it says more about you as a student than her as a professor. She truly cares about all of her students and their mental health and is extremely understanding of your needs as a person and not just as another student. Would recommend as a prof.
I had her online. She's super nice and wants you to do well in the course. Responds to emails pretty quick. Posts reading guides and notes on the main things you should know for each chapter. Graded on exams, quizzes, and maybe a hw or two. Exams tend to be very book based & can be pretty tough, but not always. Also, offers some extra credit!
Overall Jodee is a nice person, but rambles a lot during lectures. Quizzes every week, 4 exams through out the year, no homework. She is not very good at communicating when quizzes and exams will be during the week and usually throws them out there whenever. Personally would not take her again.
Dr. Hunt is an amazing prof. She cares about her students succeeding and she is the sweetest person! However, she gives no homework. She only gives exams and quizzes every week. There definitely is not a cushion for your grade. You need to pay in lecture and take notes to do well in this class. A lot of effort required, but worth it!
I have taken a class with Dr. Hunt before and I loved her, but online format is not for her. If you can avoid taking an online class with her, DO IT! She posts way too much material and expects us to do it all within a week so she can post another quiz or exam for us to take. She does not answer emails and decided to do zooms at very random times
Taking this course online with her was a nightmare. She never actually lectured, she didn't answer questions/emails, & she refused to record the random zoom sessions that she just began offering mid-semester. She posts very complex quizzes every week at a different day/time, & that's all that's in the gradebook. Do not recommend.
I took Prof. Hunt hoping that she would be incredible based on her reviews here. I was so so wrong. She is unable to teach through the online format. She ignores emails, teaches the class on a ""read the book"" basis, and posts quizzes and exams whenever she feels like it, with little to no notice and short time frames. Do not take her online.
RUN. I had a 4.0 before this class. She does not/will not teach the material. It's entirely up to your ability to read the text book and pray to god you understand it well enough to answer her incredibly specific, confusing quiz/exam questions. Didn't even get a zoom lecture until weeks into the course. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Do not take!!
Very enthusiastic. Go to class and take notes and then make sure you take HEAVY notes on the reading assignments. The exams lean more toward the info in the book, which she barely talks about in class, but also has questions from things she mentions in class. I turned in an exam late (online) and emailed her and she gave me full credit. Very nice","Hunt is an amazing person and is hilarious. She tries to keep everyone engaged and you can tell she loves what she does. With that said, this class is not easy. You will work your butt off to maintain a good grade and that still isn't enough sometimes. Her exams are super conceptual and HARD. Take Hunt but be ready to work!"
316,"Burns is a nice guy, but I felt like I didn't learn a lot from him/his lectures. I had to read the book to do well on the exams, but if you pass those you're pretty much set. There are 4 exams and 6 quizzes (both of which he drops the lowest grade) and he offers an optional paper that will shift the point distribution to provide more leeway. 
Burns is such a nice person. This class was just more work than I expected (in person) because we had write-ups due each week. There are 3 exams which are essay exams (3 questions). Burns sometimes goes off on tangents and it confused me when listening to his lectures. He also talks really fast which is confusing at times too but he's not bad. 
Professor Burns is such a wonderful and caring professor! If you show up and do the work, you'll do great. He puts so much effort into his lectures, discussions, and PowerPoints. He's also very understanding and sweet! 
Dr. Burns is a great professor, and this is one of the best classes I have taken in my college career. Most importantly, he genuinely enjoys having the students share their own opinions and cares about students doing well in the course. If you put your best effort into your thoughts for the class discussion, you will do just fine.
This professor has been the only one at GVSU who has made a difference in my life. The class is so powerful and so important. You may have to read, but its really worth it to open your mind to the pieces he shares. Im so glad he was part of my journey!! What an amazing guy!
Larry cares about his students & makes sure everyone understands. He talks a tad fast but you to get used to it. Lectures are very engaging & he includes quick personal stories. Not mandatory to go, but the in class videos are always on exams. 4 exams & 5 quizzes, both lowest are dropped. There's an optional paper if you want to increase your grade
Such an easy class if you take good notes and use the practice exams. I had this class in person and it consisted of 4 exams and 5 quizzes. He drops your lowest quiz AND lowest exam. No papers or assignments. He does talk VERY fast and it can be hard to keep up in lectures, but it isn't terrible. He lectures right off the PowerPoint. Great class
Prof. Burns was one of the best profs I've had at GVSU. Really cares about his students, and always wants to hear what they have to say. His Capstone is discussion-based, make sure that you do the required readings so you're prepared to discuss in class. It can sound daunting but it was a really great class and I have no complaints.
Took this online, and we didn't have a single exam. Just had modules with several assignments through the online textbook. Had 5 or 6 150-200 word reflections about content covered and that was it. Lecture videos consisted of 2 minute overviews of content each week. Very nice prof and easiest A you will ever get. 
Professor Burns is truly one of the best!!! He is super caring and helpful. His capstone class is discussion-based and he does an amazing job at remaining unbiased. One of the best classes I took in my whole college career.
Larry is absolutely amazing and so caring. Makes sure to give attention to every student. Four exams, lowest grade is dropped. You do have the read the textbook chapters in order to get a good grade on the exams. The study guides weren't the most helpful. He also talks really fast. Would 100% recommend that you take him at least once. 
LARRY!!!!! I freaking loved Larry so much! He always ended class by saying ""thanks for coming"" and honestly it made my day. I would 100% take this class again! You have four exams and about six quizzes with an optional paper. The lowest quiz and exam get dropped! Definitely take Professor Burns if you have the opportunity. 
Larry is the biggest gem at Grand Valley. He is so kind and caring to his students. The lectures are really interesting and he uses a lot of examples to help explain the material, however, he can move pretty fast sometimes. He drops your lowest quiz and your lowest exam. Just make sure to read your notes AND the textbook for exams!
Larry is so nice. I didn't even have him in person! He would make videos explaining some material and talked about what to expect that week. Super easy work and easy to get an A for sure. Keep up with the weekly work and biweekly journal and you'll do great. There were no exams bc of the weekly quizzes ( you get unlimited attempts)
All of the exam information comes straight from the book, but you have to go to lecture to get the in class examples. His lectures are enjoyable and he gives a lot of examples that are helpful to understanding material. Have to read book, but the exams are easy to study for. Very caring prof and I would love to have him again!
Professor Burns is a really amazing professor. You can tell he cares a lot about his students. I would say that going to class is necessary because if you don't go you will miss a lot of material. His lectures are always interesting, but sometimes they go really fast. Be prepared to catch up outside of class.
If you took abnormal psych in high school, this class is a breeze. 4 exams total (the lowest one is dropped) and an essay is offered for extra credit. Lectures are interesting, and the prof obviously cares bout his students. Take him for an easy psych course.
I absolutely loved this Professor! This class was super interesting and it was very easy to get homework done. Took this class online, would totally recommend it. If you looking for history and systems for your major I would definitely take this professor.
Such a sweet man! The class content is beyond interesting and Professor Burns is very enthusiastic about everything. Even if the content was so interesting, I think he would be able to make it interesting. He also genuinely cares so much about his students. You are graded on 3 of 4 exams and 5 of 6 quizzes. I highly recommend this class.","Larry cares about his students & makes sure everyone understands. He talks a tad fast but you to get used to it.

321,"Mean and absurdly dismissive of students. If you don't follow something, then he will laugh if you ask a question and typically move on anyway.
Bert is the man. He made the dreaded Freshman 178 course enjoyable and entertaining. Very funny dude and does not grade harshly AT ALL. Class is not mandatory, but going to class is not bad. I can honestly say that I will miss this class next semester.
I got placed into GenChem1 and hated it. I hate chemistry and it was really hard, especially with how fast we went through material. That being said, he doesn't set the pace and will help you if you ask! He reframed a lot of material in terms I could understand better using analogies that I get. He's funny and loveable, but the material is hard.
Literally, just don't. He's the worst. Expects everyone to be some type of Chemistry genius, like him. Not helpful, even if you go to his office hours. Way too much homework, but that's kinda a dept. thing. Either way, you'd be better off with another professor.
Holmes is the man. If you struggle with this guy as your professor, stay away from chemistry.
He will come across as mean, but if you get on his good side... which isn't hard, even if you struggle in class, then he is a lot nicer. He does assign a lot of homework, but that is why most of his class does better than the other Gen  Chem classes. It is a hard course. Stick with it and don't blame Holmes. The other gen chem profs are far worse!!
easy to get along with and funny
Holmes is actually a good teacher. He is pretty inaccessable outside of class and gives alot of homework but I have to admit that he explains the material pretty clearly and gives out worksheets ALOT to help reinforce the learning. If your a person who needs continual practice to fully understand topics he is your guy.
This is the hardest course I have taken thus far.  He does not lecture well because he thinks everyone should know everything already.  Do not approach him outside of class, it will not go well.
Class is incredibly difficult, if you don't have a solid background in Chemistry you're in for a ton of studying. He isn't a bad person, but will come across as mean if you don't understand his humor. Overall, he's knowledgable, but unless you are a genius at Chemistry, you're pretty much out of luck
He is really hard, I would not recommend taking him unless you have lots of spare time. He is really funny and a great teacher, but if you do not understand the material in class, you are out of luck. The class is very fast-paced and he assigns tons of homework. Do not take him if you have a learning disability because he does not understand them.
Not bad, comes off as mean but isn't really I don't think.  Tests are hard.
He's very cool and helpful.  Get to know him outside of class and he'll like you more.  He has a strange sense of humor and you shouldn't take things he says too seriously.  He teaches well and is willing to provide extra help to those who need it.
Professor Holmes is the man!! I wouldn't trade him for any chemistry teacher/professor in the world. He is simply amazing, so helpful and make chemistry seem like 5th grade math.
pchem is so hard. Holmes is very intelligent and a great professor although it can be hard to follow if you're not a math person. Great professor for research.
He is a good teacher. Probably the best at teaching Chem 111. I was not the best in the class, but he was still kind to me and never made me feel dumb. Very friendly outside of class and was always willing to help if I needed it. Do not listen to all the negative reviews.
He can be alright sometimes. His LSIC was interesting, though needed some modifications. He can be alright when you get to know him, so if he's your prof, go talk to him if you have questions. I've heard he's not that good at teaching chem, though. Take if you're interested in the LSIC class.
Horrid, run for your life!  He loves the smart kids, but thinks those who aren't good at chemistry are destined to be stupid.  Insulting in class if you ask a less than brilliant question.  Very hard to talk to outside of class.  Seriously, he's an ass. Take someone else.
If you are smart, you are his best friend.  If you have trouble or need help, you are screwed with him.
bert's cool, his classes are better if you talk to him outside of class for a little while, you get more of a sense of the essence of bert. but he's not boring, and helped me out quite a bit.","He is really hard, I would not recommend taking him unless you have lots of spare time.

322,"He is a complete ****. He cheated and improved his daughter's grade from a C to an A.
Fantastic professor!
BUY THE PACKET! DON'T BUY HIS BOOK IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY, BUT GET THE PACKET MEMORIZE IT (SERIOUSLY)AND GO TO CLASS ONLY TO FIND OUT WHEN THE EXAMS ARE YOU'LL BE FINE! HE'S THE BIGGEST...CAN'T SAY, BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW IT ALL LIKE HE SAYS...GOOD LUCK!
I enjoyed his stories; I don't see how they were relevant to class whatsoever, but I found him entertaining nonetheless. But yes, he turns INTRO to Sociology into an impossible discipline. He should just stick to being a therapist, although I wonder how he fairs with that.
I would have to say, out of any professor i've ever had, Dr. Direnzo tops the list on being loud and obnoxious at times. He is definitely an acquired taste... if you can deal listening to him for an hour and you study the test pack, you should do alright in this class. Not easy but not hard either.
WORST PROFESSOR EVER. Do not take ANY class he teaches, everything said about him thus far is true.  It's not the material that makes it difficult, it's him.  Avoid at all costs.
I graduated from ud last year and this guy was the worst prof ever, probably in the entire history of academia. He is a total jerk. some one should clue him in on this website to destroy his lousy, self-rightous ego. Hope he has a rotten xmas.
A dipicable, poor excuse for a human being.  He is George Castanza's evil twin.  Grumpy, angry man who needs to stop bragging about himself.  To top it all off he is a bad professor who does not relay any useful info to his students.
Wow this guy wrote a text book.  Too bad his is an embarrasment to the scholarly world.  His ""colleagues"" don't like him either.  Do not take class.  Don't even consider it.
This class was awful! The lectures were pointless and had nothing to do with the material on the tests.  This class brought down my GPA.  definitely do not take this class!!!
worst teacher i have ever had. Test are impossible and his lecures are pointless and have nothing to do with the material. DROP HIS CLASS ASAP!!
Worst class I have ever taken, his stories are cheesy and boring and he likes to brag...Other than that the bright side is that the lectures have nothing to do with the test material and you just signed up for the biggest waste of time on campus.  =)
Worst class I have ever taken.He is arrogant, self-righteous, condescending, and offensive-needs to make the world feel stupid so he can feel smart. Lectures are pointless. If you must take the class, buy the testbank, where almost all test Q's come from
i am currently studying over 2000 notecards from the test bank because this is the only way to pass the class....if you take this class, you will hear nothing but stories of how he is the greatest man in the world.... stay away, you still have a chance...
Never around when you need help, i.e. he never responds to e-mails and he only has office hours twice a week for a half hour each.  Makes you buy HIS book for $50 then HIS test packet for $50.  He talks about nothing and cares nothing of the students.
Absolute waste of time, and class. He lectures about NOTHING, then his tests are impossible. I had to change it to pass/fail to keep the grade from killing my GPA. DO NOT TAKE
Class is very interesting. Easy to understand. A lot of reading. Buy the sample test booklet...you won't regret it. Fun, easy to get an A if you take notes like crazy and read the book.
Class is fun to go to but the tests are so impossible to get an A in. I study like hell and get B's and C's. Take the class if u want to be amused but other then that steer clear!
Avoid this class like you would avoid the plague!! This man is absolutely ridiculus. There is no way other than lucky guessing to get an A in this class.  You could study all you want and still get a C.  That's just the way he works.","Worst class I have ever taken.He is arrogant, self-righteous, condescending, and offensive-needs to make the world feel stupid so he can feel smart.

326,"Dr. Copenhaver is an incredibly intelligent professor who will do anything to help his students pass, but they have to be willing to put the work in. He can be VERY confusing at times in class, so I encourage going into his office hours AS SOON as you get confused otherwise it's very easy to fall behind.  He just needs to know that you care.
Copenhaver is the glue in the music department at GVSU. He's a great professor and really loves his job. His lectures are as fun as they are participatory, but that doesn't mean it's easy. The material is presented in a simple manner, but he doesn't hold back any punches. Daily homework. Tough tests. Attendance isn't mandatory, but HIGHLY recommend
Copenhaver is brilliant and hilarious. His lectures can be a little scattered, he tends to interrupt with jokes, but if you pay close attention you will be fine. He gives all the information you need. He's always willing to give help and is not a super harsh grader. He also has fantastic outfit choices. Wish I had more classes with him.
Want to pass this class? Three words. GET. A. TUTOR.  I came into theory with virtually no knowledge in the subject. However, the fact that I'd played piano for years saved me. Despite being a hard worker, I struggled VERY much in Copenhaver's class. He is a brilliant man and musician,  but his teaching style is abstract and unorganized.
Copenhaver is a great teacher! He's extremely difficult though. I had to have a lot of 1 on 1 time with him so he could re explain the material to me. However, he totally respected me for doing this. So that's highly recommended. He also doesn't pick on you as much if you see him for help. See him before seeing a tutor so you know what he wants. 
Really helpful.
Good professor.  Just follow directions exactly.
Great guy, but a VERY difficult teacher... be prepared to work. He tends to favor people who have a passion for the subject. Lots of opportunities to improve your grade though. Extremely difficult, but most interesting class I've ever had.
Quirky personality and very interested in what he teaches. Discourages students with hurtful comments and is very unorganized- often misplaces students work (but blames the student).
The bad: Disorganized, sometimes difficult to understand, and plays favorites a little. The good: Wicked intelligent, ALWAYS willing to help, passionate about theory, and grades things very quickly. Bonus points for his fantastic outfits. But ask lots of questions, get help in office hours, and study with a friend, because tests are very difficult!
Dr. C is one of the most useless teachers I've ever had.  He's unorganized, scattered brained his tests are TERRIBLE. Just pay attention and read the book, and you'll do OKAY. Good guy- horrific teacher.
Excellent professor. You can expect tough tests, but he's always willing to help you after hours. he's super funny, but he know his subject. highly recommendable
This professor constantly belittles his students and is not very helpful.
Dr. C is an extremely intelligent musician who is very good at teaching the complexities of music through easy to understand methods. He is also very willing to meet with students for extra help. He's definitely my favorite music professor at GV. He goes quickly, so pay attention in class.
Dr. C is extremely intelligent and extremely helpful! If you don't understand something, just go to his office hours. He is very funny and loves helping students.
Dr. C is perhaps the best teacher i have EVER had! I am now in grad school and still remember how amazing he was! I had 4 classes with him, one I had failed with another prof. He was brilliant, funny, and made class interesting. Any prof who writes a song to teach you music theory deserves an A+ in my book! He will demand that you try and LEARN.
Dr. C is my dad. He cooks me dinner but not during class.
Pretty much the most rewarding musical class i have ever taken. Came in knowing next to nothing left with practical music theory skills. The class is not easy but you will gain many skills
He acts like a kid in a grown ups body...just like most of the profs in the GVSU music department.
He's a cool guy and a brilliant musician, but I do not like how he taught this class. He jumps way ahead to things you don't need to know yet which makes it confusing and challenging, and then doesn't spend enough time on what you should be learning.  He is very disorganized in his teaching. The homework was often impossible and not helpful.","Great guy, but a VERY difficult teacher... be prepared to work.

329,"Professor Jinn is a good Professor to take for stats. I had to retake it due to dropping the first time but I got a B+ easily in this class and Im not good at math. Its open everything. If you come to class, do the homework and take good notes, you will pass.
yells at you when you ask questions about the grade you got on an assignment. hard to understand
Professor Jinn is a very tough grader. His lectures are an experience for sure. If you get an A in his course I envy you. He grades super fast for the most part. Even my final exam was available to me within a day.
Professor Jinn's sense of humor takes a bit of getting used to, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. He covers everything in class, so as long as you go and take notes, the book isn't necessary. All his tests are open note, and the final is non-cumulative. He's not the most exciting professor, but as long as you put in some effort it's an easy A.
Dr. Jinn doesn't care about long-term learning, and spent more time making fun of the students than lecturing about the content. He asked the female students inappropriate questions involving their romantic lives, and refused to answer good questions, such as ""why is ____ the case?"" All in all, I would not take this professor again.
Professor Jinn likes to mock and make fun of his students. Don't ask any questions and you'll be fine. He allows you to use your book and notes on all exams and quizzes, but he doesn't teach you very well that way you can understand the information. Professor Jinn assigns little homework because he doesn't want to grade.
His lectures are very clear. He walks you through exactly what you need to do which was very helpful because I can not do anything related to numbers. He tells a lot of stories, which can be distracting--but they're usually really funny.
He is a little intimidating at first, but he is a great professor.  He has a great sense of humor;  I laughed in every single class.  He is very clear on what he expects on his exams and quizzes.  Make sure to make it to every lecture!  He is a tough grader, but extremely fair.
Funny guy, and makes his lectures accessible, but a rather unforgiving grader. DO NOT SKIP HIS LECTURES.
Prof. Jinn is a very nice guy and has an interesting sense of humor. He uses relevant examples in his lectures , he loves when you ask questions and is always willing to help. My only problem was that I'm not very good at math so it was hard for me to maintain a B. The tests were a little hard to understand but overall, he's pretty good.
Professor Jinn was by far the worst professor I've had in my 4 years as a student. He regularly told us that we should know things, and rather than slowing down and trying to catch us up, he would berate us and then continue, effectively confusing us and preventing progress. He was not even close to accommodating. I would NOT recommend at all.
Hilarious. Made the fairly boring study material more interesting. 
This guy is hilarious! Not only is he really good at teaching you stats, but he also gives amazing life lessons. His accent takes a few days to get used to, but you get passed it. Great guy all around.
If you aren't majoring in Stats, and it comes easily to you, or even if you like teaching yourself, Prof. Jinn is fine. He's (sorta not really) funny, and there isn't much work. If you need to use Stats anytime after 215 however, I would NOT take this professor
Dr. Jinn is a funny guy who knows what he is talking about. Some of his lectures can be a bit confusing as he often switches between humor and reality. Honestly, his class was fairly easy with just a couple of exams. If you attend class, its not a difficult class to get an A.
Prof Jinn is a really funny guy, his accent is hard to understand at first but its tolerable and you get used to it as the semester goes on. His exams for this class were difficult but they are all open ""anything"", which basically means book, notes, and all handouts given which basically lays out the steps for you. Be ready to do SAS projects(7)
Professor Jinn's analogies are hilarious. I will always remember Bonferroni method :)
Most hilarious professor I've ever taken!!! And the class super easy. Tests weren't too difficult and they were completely open noteopen book and the projects were practically given to you.
Prof. Jinn is hilarious! Honestly just loved class because of his personality. He can be condescending but that's his sense of humor. Overall, if you just listen, you'll get an A. The programming at first is kinda difficult, but once you get the hang of it, the class is a piece of cake. If you're a stats majorminor, highly recommend.
Prof. Jinn is a awesome teacher who gives you clear statistics examples from daily life. Make it much easier to understand this hard class! Definitely recommend!!","Prof. Jinn is a very nice guy and has an interesting sense of humor.

331,"Very tough grader on essays/discussion posts and will sound harsh in his feedback. Will help if you reach out to him though! Not many lecture's to watch, and if there is a lecture for the week it's short. 
Steve Tripp is one of the best professors I have ever taken. I have taken him twice and he is very caring for his students. He also does role-play games which are intimidating at first but are fun and better than the traditional way of learning history. If you have a chance to take him, do it! 
Read a lot! He also really favors suck-ups. Tripp was caring towards students and an optimistic person. 
One of my favorite professors! His class was online and he made it so easy to get in touch with him and allowed for essay rewrites so you can easily improve your grade! Definitely take him if you can!!!!
Choose a different professor.
Tripp was my favorite professor last semester! He expects a lot from your writing but gives very clear feedback on how to improve. He wants class to be interesting and is really funny. His class definitely required the most work compared to others but I enjoyed it overall. Highly recommend doing the readings and taking notes-its helpful for essays
Tripp can be very harsh when he grades your papers and he responds with an attitude a lot. Definitely have to work hard for your grade. He allows re writes so do them! That being said he was funny and told a lot of personal stories.
Prof Tripp truly wants his students to succeed. Allows rewrites on all papers, no midterm, and we only had one pop quiz. Graded on 4 papers, a couple writing assignments, and a roleplay game (which was hilarious and engaging). He tells lots of personal stories, not much reading, and very accessible outside of class. My favorite professor! Take him!
Expects everyone to have completely different answers on papers. Also be ready to talk and become his class pet or he will instantly look down on you and often be disrespectful. I missed a class once and he didn't send out an email on the changes he made on an assignment during class, so I emailed him for clarification and he responded harshly.
Prof Tripp was very understanding and helpful. He expects you to do the work he assigns, but is willing to help you however he can. If you read and do the homework, you will pass.
Prof. Tripp is a great person and a GREAT professor. All of the bad ratings are people who probably do not try in the slightest because I found his class to be stimulating and not that hard if you just do the work. Yes, there is a lot of reading, but he gives out work that is very interesting (HST 103) and he is always willing to help.
I think that Prof. Tripp is one of the best professors. He is so knowledgable about all of the content we go over, and if you ever need help he's always there for you. He gives great lectures and talks about all the readings in class. It is a little bit difficult because it deeps so in depth about some historical times but he makes the class so fun
Professor Tripp expects you to participate in class but yet when you are talking he interrupts you so much. He is a hard grader and is not very good when it comes to answering questions.
Very good at being available to help students. He doesn't hand it to you, you need to work hard for your grade, meet with him, do the readings and pay attention in class. I saw my writing skills increase over the course of his class where I didnt feel I learned too much
His class can be challenging. The lectures are dull at times, and he tends to be a tough grader. But I wouldn't worry too much. He allows unlimited rewrites on every paper except the final. Tripp's an amazing professor. He's funny, caring, and truly wants his students to succeed. At office hours, we talked about fall break and new movies. Great guy
He is a tough grader on the papers, but gives quality typed feedback and lets you do rewrites up until the final is due. He is funny and tells a lot of personal anecdotes. Some pop quizzes, so make sure you do the reading. He lets you use whatever notes you take for the quizzes.
I would not recommend this Prof to anyone. If possible, take someone else. His grading is near impossible, and he does not seem to understand how to talk to students. This is my major, and I have never had such a horrible history Prof in all seven years of my college experience.
Tripp is one of the best professors at Grand Valley! I'm not gonna lie, he gives a lot of reading, and you definitely have to earn your A on his papers. He gives a ton of feedback, he is always accessible outside of class, and he does paper re-writes for almost every paper! Also he tells a lot of hilarious personal stories!
A lot of reading for class. Lectures are mostly based around power points and reading material. Only 3 exams the whole semester. He tried to make class interesting. Helps if you participate in discussions. If you don't show to class, you have to get the notes from another student.
I hated the assigned readings, especially toward the end of the semester when we had to read an entire novel. Make sure to take good notes because they are allowed on quizzes. The exams aren't too bad and the lectures can be a little dry sometimes. Overall not a bad professor","His class can be challenging. The lectures are dull at times, and he tends to be a tough grader.

Do everything within your power to take this course with him as it will literally change your life. LiveLaughLove!
Daniel Chester is experienced and kind. It's a joy to have him at the University of Delaware.
He really has passion for what he teaches and is a great guy. I learned a lot from hum. I would take another class with him.
Dr. Chester is the man! He really levels with his students and knows a lot. Just go to office hours and have a conversation with him. You can learn a lot from him!
His handwriting is completely illegible, and yet he insists on writing everything.
Professor Chester is an expert in game theory, I love stopping by his office and start a conversation about game theory, he will give you a lot of interesting examples about game theory. It is always a pleasure to talk with him. 
First and last class I have had with chester. I thought this class may be a little bit better considering it was AI in Games, something that I thought would've at least been made interesting when going to class. Bottomline Chester has probably exceeded the prime of his teaching and should probably just stick to being an admin in the department.
Chester isn't as terrible as everyone makes him out to be. He has a good sense of humor, but his handwriting is terrible and he is fairly bad at explaining concepts, and sometimes (often) gets lost or makes a mistake while doing problems in class. The textbook is quite good and considering the class really doesn't cover much material, it's not hard
Horrible. Boring in class, and heunnecessarily abstracts easy concepts until he confuses himself (and every student) and then he forgets what he was saying in the first place. Homeworks are ridiculous and he does not coordinate with his TA at all. Around a 40% overall was a C, and not much higher is a B.
Hard Course. He shouldn't teach this course. Can't understand what he says. Should never ever use blackboard. Handwriting Sucks
Dan Chester was such an awful teacher that when I realized there were professors rated lower than him, I was forced to rate him to undo this gross injustice. His lectures were boring and worthless, and even he couldn't understand what he was trying to do half the time. Avoid if at all possible, if it is not possible, good luck.
The man is the worst professor I have ever had.  Mumbles as he proceeds to read off of slides of code which don't really make any sense to anyone.  Useless if you ask him a question, he will just talk about something else.  Tests are impossible...class average is around a 60.  Don't take a class with him EVER.
Quite possibly the worst excuse for a teacher I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of being charged with.  To say he can't teach is an understatement.  I'm also not completely sure that HE understands the material we're supposed to be learning.  Mumbles a lot and reads directly from slides that were - no doubt - downloaded right from the web. Stay away!
Should spend less time exploring the universe and more time learning how to frickin teach
This guy can't teach. Period. I'm a comp sci major and had all A's in my comp sci classes until this one. He mumbles off slides and you can't hear what he's saying. His tests and projects don't reflect the material. Don't waste your time attending class. It's so boring. Just stay home and read the book.
I am amazed they let this guy ""teach"".  By far the worst class and professor I have had.  ""Useless"" and ""incomprehensible"" are fitting descriptions.  Half-assed recitations of half-assed slides from a half-assed textbook make for a piss-poor class.  Staggering...
Does not know how to teach undergrad students. Just reads off slides and cannot simplify the info. If you can take the class with another prof., do it! He does not even do the homeworks before he hands them out.
If you have 40 hours of free time and go to www.db-book.com (which contains slides created by the book authors) you can definitely learn the material better than when he teaches it.  The only reason to take him is if you need it for a co-req for CISC474 and there is absolutely no other choice.  Bottom line: avoid not for difficulty, but for sanity.
Terrible professor, mumbles constantly, reads directly from slides and does not stop to ask if there are any questions.  He just assumes that everyone knows exactly what he's talking about.  I cannot believe that the univeristy is still allowing him to teach.  Don't go to class it'll just be a waste of your time.",Quite possibly the worst excuse for a teacher I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of being charged with.  To say he can't teach is an understatement.  I'm also not completely sure that HE understands the material we're supposed to be learning.

335,"So the first two exams were ridiculously easy. She was very helpful in the first two since she did reviews before the exam. However, the 3rd and final exam were the worst. I managed to get 90% on the first two exams and barely 30% on the last two. She does not curve. She expects this class as a high school review to you and asks many tric questions
Do your homework, go to class and your fine. If you need office hours she is always helpful. Warning tests may be on the hard side thats why I stress doing the homework. She helps a lot at review and her notes are good, no surprises there.
Really sweet lady. She was always respectful and answered questions. Math has never been my subject. I didn't do too well in her class, but if you're okay at pre-calc, I would recommend her. She moves quick; lots of homework on coursecompass.
Easy class but she does not teach what is on the test.  Easy quizzes after tests.  Very BORING
I took Stat 1 online over winter session. The course starts of quickly, week 1 you watch a ton of lectures but then week 2 you have the whole week to study for your exam. So its a little bit of a rollercoaster. The material is pretty straight forward. I would recommend this over taking it compaired to a traditional course.
Terrible teacher!! Took her for 117 and was overwhelmed. She flies through lessons at laser speed. Her gradings are harsh and unforgiving.
never been good at math, but i got an A in this class without doing any of the homeworks...great teacher and very nice to her students. DEFINITELY go to the reviews. She always goes over problems that are identical to problems on the test
She is not the best math teacher. She teach fast as f16. Even many of students dont understand she dont care about that. Confusing. I hated her class. Although she is helpful but the speed of her teaching is extremely fast and non understandable.
Amazing teacher.  She is just awesome.  Had her for Math 117.  She may go a tad fast, but she dumbs everything down and makes sure everyone understands the material.  Extremely nice woman and is willing to help you with anything.  Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed!
Took Prof Ebert online for MATH201 - best decision of my life. There were 18 lectures total, I chose when I wanted to watch them or do anything for the class. Don't slack too much, or at least be prepared to make up the work when you do. Three tests and three problem sets, nothing too difficult. I'd recommend online if you have work ethic
course compass-- i hate it.  alot of online homework, class is very fast paced so if you've never taken pre-calc before youll probably be lost.  HAVE to go to class, you can only miss 2 and then after that its 5 points off your grade for each class you miss.
She's a good teacher, very clear. I hated the online homework, but I think all math classes use that. The tests can be a bit tricky, but she provides practice tests which really help, and office hours. If you have to take this class, take it with her.
I had her for precalc and although she was very nice, i struggled. She moves very fast and exams were very hard. Online homework and short, easy quizzes help pull up your grade. Dont buy the book. I never opened it because she gives good notes. Overall she was a good teacher.
Great teacher & very helpful. Homework isn't mandatory, but do it and you'll be prepared for exams. Although exams are on exactly what she says, read questions CAREFULLY. She can word things to where you might be tricked. 3 exams & a final, quizzes are easy points, attendance is mandatory. Overall wonderful person
Dr. Ebert is a great teacher. Explains everything clearly & goes slow enough to make sure everybody understands.  Study old exams. Quizzes are short and easy b/c she tells you what will be on them. I got an A. highly recommended
I took this class online. The lecture notes were pretty clear. The examples she gives on the slides will be sufficient in order to do well on all of the tests, problem sets, and two simple projects. She is a little slow about grading things, but she will hand everything back to you so you can see the mistakes you made. Not a bad class.
Prof. Ebert is a great women and shes very helpful. She moves a little fast, but tells you almost everthing thats on the test. Test are tricky though so make sure you study the problems she tells you to do. I would definitely recommend taking her!
great lady. makes understanding calc crystal clear. really cares about whether or not you do well, would highly recommend going to her study sessions before the test, it basically garuntees an A. dr. ebert was the best.
i used to hate math and found it to be really hard but she was extremely clear and very fair on grading. shes a really understanding teacher-probably one of the best math teachers i've had.
she is not a good professor","Great teacher & very helpful. Homework isn't mandatory, but do it and you'll be prepared for exams.

336,"She plays it fast and loose with her lesson plan, but we always learn a lot.
Taught more about whats wrong with her life than math. Gives hw to do before discussing the topics. Get an outline before unfair & hard tests that don't resemble outline. Destroys your proofs and never returns them after promising for over a month, yet continues to have you turn in another one?? Excuse after excuse, very maddening and unhelpful.
Discreet math is abstract and she keeps it abstract, you and I mean you have to relate the material you are trying to learn to new things all the time, I don't recommend her, my first C ever. You feel like your on island. It's a sink or swim mentality with no scaffolding whatsoever. She is teaching 210 in January, beware.
Karen is a great professor. She definitely wants you to excel in the language of mathematics and will make sure you get there. I couldn't score above a C on any of my proofs in any math class until my last proof for Karen. I think all Math students should take Karen at least once at GVSU. The class wasn't too bad with HW but take it seriously.
Karen is great. Had her for 210 as well, both very challenging classes. She will make you work hard and earn your grade, but it's totally worth it. She can be intimidating at first, but is always willing to help you as long as you are trying.
I had her for 345 as well and... you either love or hate her. She's SO smart that you initially feel dumb, but she's just weeding out the people who truly care about their education. She's not even close to easy, but she appreciates effort even after she turns you down the first (or second) time. You really learn from her! I highly recommend her!
Dr. Novotny is a very intelligent woman. So intelligent, that she makes her students feel stupid. She spends the first few minutes of class complaining about her life. She expects you to remember everything from 210. She makes you feel even more stupid for coming to her office hours. I would never recommend her to anyone.
One of the toughest professors I've ever had. That being said, I learned more about how to write mathematical argument than in any other class. Had very high expectations, and - if you went to her office - would help you to meet them. If you take Euclidean or Non-Euclidean Geometry, take her section.
Oh Karen. She is an awesome professor. She assigns a LOT of pre-class homework, but usually it can get done in about 15 minutes. She gets a little overwhelmed with all of her classes, so you'll never have all of the homework the syllabus says. She really cares about your education. I would DEF recommend her! Don't assume she doesn't know something.
She was fantastic.  I've never had a teacher that genuinely cared about me learning until I took her.  It is a LOT of work, and a pretty tough course, but you will be a better student because of her.
She is so helpful during office hours but make sure you put in an honest effort and know what questions you want to ask. Also get a study group together because it is very helpful. Do the ""homework"". She is a fair person and while can sometimes make you feel bad, you just improve from her criticisms.
One of the better math profs at GV. I really enjoyed this class because of her. Be prepared for a pretty heavy workload but overall, it has helped me in my other math classes. She is very approachable and willing to meet with people out of class. Make sure not to skip this class!
I hated this class. It was long and hard to listen to her for 2 hours. However, she got me to learn the material. She didn't give back graded work in a timely fashion and was not really approachable at all. But if you need to take this class she isn't the worst prof you could take.
If you would like assignments graded and returned to you do not take Karen.  She NEVER returns or grades anything and doesn't respond to emails.  She's helpful and explains material in class, but expects you to know a lot before entering class.   Overall, shes average, just don't expect to ever have your work graded.
Prof. Novotny is very helpful and knowledgeable. She is passionate about the material and passes that passion on to her students. I've never enjoyed math, but her class was fun! Provides a lot of useful information and materials for your future. Material isn't too hard, but there's a lot of it. Go to class and put forth effort and you'll do fine.
Novotny is wonderful. She is always willing to help and will look over any homework that you have before you have to turn it in to her. She is always prepared and really enjoys teaching. I would take any course from Karen without any reservations. Expect to do work, but that is a given with any upper level math course. Novotny makes it worth it.
At the beginning I'd have to say I was a little intimidated. Although the workload can be heavy at times, none of it is impossible. Dr. Novotny is very knowledgable, clear, and organized. The exams are reasonable as long as you go to class. I came out of this class knowing so much more. I highly recommend this prof!
Dr. Novotny obviously loves to teach, and will do anything to help you do well.  All the good things you read about her on this website are true.  Highly recommended!
Professor Novotny was very helpful, you can go to her with any questions that you have.  The Proof Portfolio is very hard, but you can meet with her and she will help clear things up.  She makes class fun...
Dreaded this class like a beating every day.  Its a hard class but Dr. N is so helpful and really cares about her students.  I was at her office at least twice a week and she was always always happy to help.  She is a really caring and understanding prof.","She is so helpful during office hours but make sure you put in an honest effort and know what questions you want to ask.

337,"I put hours into her assignments and have yet to get 100% she says that she ""reserves the right"" to grade 1 question out of your entire assignment and will choose the question that has the worst answer and give you your grade based on that. Don't take her unless you want a lot of unnecessary work and if you don't want an A bc you're not getting one
This was a pretty easy course if you make sure to study. Deb is always willing to answer questions. On chapter activity days sometimes we got to leave early. Exams are online open throughout the weekend. Only downside is that sometimes during lecture she would sound kind of condescending.
Easy professor. You take notes for the whole 50 min every time. Exams were online, open note, outside of class, and given the whole weekend to take them. In class activities, but she gives full points as long as you do it. You don't learn much, but I'd recommend Deb for an easy A.
Professor Simon was a very caring professor and was very understanding. However, her class is very heavy on note taking and that was really all we did. I would be forced to teach myself the content on my own outside of class because I was trying to keep up with her notes in class. However, she offered lots of extra credit to boost people's grades. 
Prof. Simon was very helpful.  She can come off as intimidating or rude but she cares about your education and will happily help if you ask a question or need extra explaining.  The lecture is mandatory, missing one means you miss out on a lot of useful notes.  Be prepared to take lots of notes and do not forget to do the online homework Great Prof
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I think she doesn't realize that we are mostly freshmen, not PhD students. Her class is too hard and confusing without reason. She has notes she writes on a white board, and I honestly dont think she reviews them; she absolutely just pulls them out of her head on the spot. She literally rephrases the same thing repeatedly
I think that overall the class was extremely easy and there was even opportunities for extra credit. The only issue is that the class itself was heavily focused on notetaking. 
This class is horrible to take, wish I would've taken it at a community college. If you have to take BIO120, take it with another professor! The lectures are horrible and she doesn't explain anything ever. When I tried contacting her about my grades she told me to go read the syllabus instead of just helping me. 
Comprehensive Guide to taking Debs class: Dont
I dont recommend having Simon as your professor. She reads off a PowerPoint, minimal explanations and it drives you to sleep. She does in class questions, even if you missed a few away from receiving a 100%, she gives no room to fix it. My grade went from a 90 to a low B right before finals! It was pointless and you learn nothing, frustrating 100%
There are many Bio120 teachers, and I would take anyone of them before I took her class again. The biggest problem were her in-class questions; they are near impossible. They brought my semester grade down 6% the last day of the semester. Tests are all online. Not too much homework. Lecture Heavy. If you HAVE TO take Deb, get a tutor day 1.
Do not take this professor! She was awful. Her lectures were so fast I couldnt even focus on what I was writing as I wrote it. No one had time to ask questions and her lectures were so crammed with info, nothing stuck. Her style of teaching is making you write down notes verbatim from what she writes on a whiteboard
AVOID AT ALL COSTS, SPREAD THE WORD TO AVOID HER. Worst Professor Ive ever had. Participation grade is based on your ability to answer an impossibly hard question, showed up to every single class but got an attendance grade of a 60%. When the whole class failed a midterm, she blamed it on us and said it was our fault we didn't study hard enough
Her whole class was a lecture and students never got to ask questions. It was an easy class to pass and i would take with her again but it wasn't the best learning environment. she never got the students involved.
Theres these in class questions every time the class meets, which for me was three days out of the week. Theyre impossibly difficult and no matter how hard I studied for them I still managed to get a good handful wrong. For lecture she reads straight from the book and doesnt explain any of the material. She was kind, and all exams were online.
If you have her, switch IMMEDIATELY! We wrote 3-4 pages of notes in 50 minute sessions , that she doesnt even clarify. She threatened to fail me due to my sickness conducted with missing class. The book was over $100 and all we use for it is assignments. The test and quizzes are timed & doesnt add up to the notes. She treats us like were senior.
She flies through lecture notes with minimal explanation- I think she simply just reads out of the textbook. I never have enough time to write down everything she writes and says. If you want to pay for someone to read a textbook to you take this class with her.
There was definitely a lot of note-taking in this class, but it was all super specific which helped. I liked that all the tests and exams were online. That part of the class is super convenient. Overall, I don't think that Professor Simon was too hard of a teacher, but you definitely need to put the time and effort in to get a good grade.
The class is pretty tough, like most bio classes, but she's pretty concise about the information. I don't recommend her to people who are taking bio as a gen-ed, but for people who need it for their major, she makes sure you have a solid foundation. A quick note: you WILL need to do extra studying outside of class to get a good grade.
never taking her class again she is not understanding at all and her exams are based on only her lectures. waste of money for the textbook.","Theres these in class questions every time the class meets, which for me was three days out of the week.

341,"Rod was a G. Definitely recommend to other gvsu students. 
I love Prof Morgan. I have him online so I dont really know him that well, but I met with him for office hours and it was very obvious that he really cares about his students, beyond just homework. He is so understanding with mental health and gives extensions if theyre needed. Highly recommend taking his class if you have the chance.
Hes by far one my my favorite professors here! He's so nice, understadning, and makes lecture/lab alot of fun and interesting, cant say that about many profs. He is very clear on what to expect for exams and doesnt expect you to know every detail but the main concept to your understanding. Hes a pretty easy grader I would say compared to most.
Morgan is an amazing professor. I've had him for a few classes and it's been great every time. The content is HARD, but he makes it bearable. I would dread coming to class if it wasn't for him! His study guides are pretty clear cut and the exams are hard just because of the content, but he gives TONS of partial credit.
Professor Morgan is an amazing teacher for lab. He walks students through every lab, and has you work on it in small chunks. Everything is taught in a clear and effective way, and he grades fairly easily. As someone who is always stressed over lab, I can say that Prof. Morgan made lab stress free and fun! Highly recommend, nice and easy professor.
This class was very organized. Students are required to READ the syllabus in order to know when assignments were due. Papers were really easy to write and were based on our own opinions. Definitely visit the writing center if you don't know how to write a paper on your own. The professor doesn't have a specific format he wants (argumentative, etc)
Don't take this class if you want to actually learn about biomedical ethics. He only grades you and gives feedback on the mechanics of your papers. The course consisted of five 500 word papers and one final paper. He did not organize this summer class well, which left most students confused and/or missing deadlines because they were so sporadic.
Dr. Morgan does a great job delivering content, but there is A LOT of it. Attending lecture was important and, even with great attendance, I used my textbook more in this class than any other. He does assign readings and WILL expect you to know information from the text. Mellow guy though, has a good sense of humor, and is helpful.
If you take BIO328 in the summer, he is transforming it into a hybrid. This makes the class very paper-heavy, but it is great not to have to come to class as much. Morgan is a really nice guy and he really knows his stuff. He gives great feedback on his papers and although the class isn't impossible, he definitely makes you work for your A.
I always hated biology, but Professor Morgan actually made me enjoy it for once. His lectures were always engaging, and class typically ended fairly early. We also did some fun experiments in class (made yogurt, looked at pond water, etc). There was NO homework besides one 5 page paper on any topic along with 3 Exams, 3 Quizzes, and Final Exam.
He is a good professor overall, and willing to answer any questions. The class is made up of 3 exams, 3 quizzes, 1 research paper, and a final exam.
Prof. Morgan makes this course very interesting and engaging for non-science majors. He is very nice, and will answer all your Q's! Biology is not my strong point, but he made the content easily understandable. There were a couple short ""fun"" in-class experiments. Grades are from exams, quizzes (fairly easy), and a short research paper.
Dr. Morgan is awesome. Science classes can be terrible if you're not a science major, but he taught the course in a simplified way that actually made it enjoyable. The tests were very fair, and overall the class was really enjoyable. I don't think there's a better honors science professor to take, so take this class.
This guy is awesome! I'm an Accounting and MIS major so science isn't my strong point but he made it so much fun (for a 6-9) and kept us engaged in the class. He's super passionate about what he's teaching so it keeps you interested in the lectures. Super easy A. Just take notes on the lectures and reference the text book for terms you don't know.
Dr. Morgan is great! He grades the assignments fairly and is very accessible outside of class and is willing to answer any questions. He genuinely wants you to do well. Take him if you can!
One of the most engaging and hilarious professors i've ever taken a class with. He's incredibly straight up about what is required for exams and lab exams.  Not the most structured lectures; however, he makes sure that you learn what is needed for the exam. His lecture vibes are relaxed and he does an excellent job at explaining difficult concepts.
Tries to make it the  most beneficial for students and understand other class work loads.
Wouldn't take him again he was a much harder grader than other lab professors I've had before. Take a diff lab instructor if you can.
Professor Morgan is a great teacher. He is enthusiastic about microbes and really drives home the most important concepts that we can use to explain many things in our lives. He encourages discussion and questions and makes the class overall very fun. This is the first science class that I genuinely enjoyed coming to. Memorize concepts for exams.
Dr. Morgan was fantastic! He knew his stuff and was very conscious of the fact that only students that aren't in the biology field had to take this course and that it was a gen ed and treated it as so. This is so much better than all the profs that assuming if you're in their class, you must be pursuing their field of study. Fantastic guy too!","Hes by far one my my favorite professors here!

342,"Not a bad class, the professor is nice and lets you correct one exam. The lectures were straightforward and posted online, making it easy to study for exams. Not super exciting, but if you pay attention or look back at the powerpoints, you'll be fine.
Ngl, Prof Madsen doesn't make a ton of jokes, but when he does he's hilarious. This is a very lecture heavy class, but I couldn't ask for better lectures to take notes on. They are extremely well organized, and he doesn't ramble on. Just pay attention in class and you'll be fine.
Prof Madsen didn't tell many jokes, but he could be really funny when he did. Any class with 1:15 long lectures will get dry after a while, but Madsen kept his lectures well organized and interesting enough. Easily the best lectures to take notes on I've had. The study guides are also really helpful for the exams.
The first part of the course is really tough. But he let's you ""correct"" one of the class exams, where you get back half of the points you lost by basically not doing much work. After that it's really easy. You don't have to even show up. Just make quizlets from the slides and practice exams are almost identical to the actual one. Labs are a pain.
Prof. Madsen is the type of professor that demands respect, not because he asks for it, but because he deserves it. My colloquium on nonrenewable & renewable energies was excellent. Do expect to write a few papers, but you have lots of room to write about what you enjoy. I'd take him again in a heartbeat. His canvas can be a little unorganized tho.
Very cool guy. Lectures aren't necessary but helpful if you go. He posts all his slides on canvas. Super helpful outside of class
A great guy! He is so kind and allows you to do test corrections on one exam grade that you would like to raise. The material is understandable and he does not try to try trick you in any way on the exams. As long as you do the study guides he posts, you will be prepared . Exams themselves are very fair and he wants everyone to do well! :)
One of the nicest Professors I have ever had. Dr. Madsen is very knowledgable about his subject and cares about his students. If you put in the effort and ask for help he will ensure you pass. He allows test corrections for half points back on one exam. Lectures are boring but worth going to because he mentions things that will be on the exam.
If you're taking this for a breadth, it's a little harder than it looks. In-class exams are almost direct reflections of the study guide, so they're somewhat easy, but lab tests are hard! And the only grades are tests, so if you're not a good test taker, this isn't the class for you.
Highly-recommended colloquium! Dr. Madsen is a bright guy who is incredibly passionate about and involved in the energy field. He discussed many facets of the energy sector and presented a balanced perspective. The class was very clearly structured. As long as you put in the required work and effort, you'll get a good grade in this class.
One of the easiest classes I've taken at UD. 3 essays, 3 group projects, clear criteria. If you just do everything you'll get an A no problem. His lectures are interesting and I liked learning the material. If you have to take an honors colloquium, take Dr. Madsen, you won't regret it.
Madsen is the best. Cares about his students. An A in his class is an 87! Gives extra credit opportunities if you show you care about his class and want to do well. Not a hard course at all, just make sure to know his slides inside and out. Never went to class, didn't buy the textbook, and still did well in his class. Would take Madsen again!
He is an amazing lecturer. He is remarkably organized and uploads the slides prior to the lecture, so during class you can really absorb what he is saying instead of trying to write everything down. His grading scale is fair and his exams are well made. He provides a study guide so you know which topics you may be tested on. Best prof ever!
Even if you struggle in madness class if you take time to meet with him he will find ways to boost your grade! not the easy A I thought it would be but not extremely challenging either
So here's the deal: Madsen is dope but this class is not if you're taking it as a lab requirement. An immense amount of material. Take 105 instead!! But madsen rocks and is helpful and caring!
His tests are based on your memory. You need to memorize everything is required. Average teacher.
Dr. Madsen was fantastic. If you're in the honors program, take him for Colloquium. His lectures are interesting, he is an easy grader, and he cares about his students. I hear that he is great for Geology as well. Definitely go with Madsen if you can. Easiest A I've earned in college so far.
I took this as an easy lab requirement but it ended up being way harder than I was expecting. Exams and lab are all memorization of useless information. Madsen wasn't bad though. Take GEOL105 instead
Dr. Madsen was an awesome professor. Super knowledgeable about geology, and his lectures are pretty fun too. He's very accessible and does care about his students doing well, even in such a large lecture.
Professor Madsen is an amazing man. He is always willing to help and wants his students to succeed. He is available outside of class whenever you need. If you study the study guide and take the practice exam, you will get an A in this class. The lecture notes are on UD Capture and he posts the slides online.","A great guy!

345,"she's racist
Dr. Horvitz is a fantastic teacher! She's funny, smart, and very clear about what a student needs to do to get a good grade in her class. She introduced me to a lot of books I wouldn't have normally read, and I enjoyed all of them. I feel like I learned a lot about the craft of writing creative nonfiction essays through her helpful comments.
Prof Horvitz is extremely nice and approachable, she responds to emails quickly, and she makes herself readily available outside of class. She assigns a lot of shorter assignments, but they're relatively consistent week-to-week so it's easy to get into a routine. Do the work and participate in class, and you'll be fine.
I've had her twice and have enjoyed her both times. She has a very warm presence and does her best to make sure everyone is living up to their potential. If you can't write one 1-page paper a week though, don't take the class... or dread it, if it's required for you - she's also a Lit professor, after all.
Honestly, would not recommend her as a faculty member. It was a once a week class, I had perfect attendance, and she would not give me any kind of absence for my grandfather's funeral. On the whole, scattered, not great with gender diverse students, very anxious. If you want a professor & class with structure or clear guidelines, this is not it.
Dr. Horvitz knows how to lead a discussion and keep her class engaged. You must participate in order to pass. She is funny and extremely intelligent; it's easy to engage with the subject matter in a meaningful way. She has high expectations of your writing, but if you're in a 300-level literature class, you should be at an appropriate skill level.
Very good professor. Demanding but clear about expectations. Fun class discussions: she's really witty and knows how to get people to talk. Papers become routine after a while. Felt like I learned a lot. Good Writing Intensive to take!
Best professor. Witty and sharp, some people get her and some people don't. Over half the class drops the first week, but those who stick it out are the winners.
I really enjoyed this class, its not too much work and dr horvitz encourages great discussions. shes a weird, but really cool, lady
Dr. Horvitz is a great teacher. i enjoyed her class the most and though her attendance policy is harsh, you'll actually come to want to go to class. As long as you read the assigned readings you'll be fine and she is not a hard grader at all. Very easy and interesting class. She actually made me want to change my major.
If you are a male you might want to find another section.  thats all.
Lori is a wonderful professor. I took her Introduction to Poetry course and cannot believe how much more comfortable I am with poetry. She requires an explication every week and will push you, but it is WORTH IT! She has a unique sense of humor and truly leads students to think for themselves. I would take her for any Lit. course!
Dr.Horvitz is incredible. Apparently some of the past comments saying she is ridiculously shy, but she's not. Don't listen to any of those old comments. I have never met anyone who didn't like Dr. Horvitz.
She has a great sense of humor and she's really helpful. I really couldn't have asked for a better professor. Take her if you really want your writing to get better.
She is the most helpful professor I have ever had. I feel like she truly cares about whether or not I am learning and making any progress. She really knows her stuff and she is always organized and on time. Different than a lot of other professors but in a good way. She's totally adorable, by the way.
Had her for women's studies. Loved it. She's a great professor. The class was completely centered around discussion. Lots of reading, lots of writing, but it'll be worth it. And she doesn't talk much, but the comments she does make are stellar.
Take her if you can! She's great.
My favorite professor I have had at UNCA. Very knowledgeable and fun to talk to... Definitely take her if you can!
Very middle of the road.  Total cold fish.  I thought she was a completely indifferent, aloof professor until I mentioned I might be leaving the major, and then she fell over backwards trying to help me find out what I needed.  Surprisingly involved and helpful.  Hard book to judge by its cover.
Lori can be misread. Although she seems to have 'low self-esteem', as someone else mentioned, she is really just quiet. I've had her for a few classes, and her sense of humor is actually excellent. A small snicker from her, though, is like a bellowing laugh from anyone else.Great professor, willing to help, and very engaging. A lot of reading, tho!","Lori can be misread.

347,"Great professor with good life experiences related to course material. very interesting person
great professor.  Knows his stuff inside and out.  uses awesome stories from real life experience as examples.  Best professor I've had.
I couldn't get past how sure of himself he was. I also didn't like the way he puts students on the spot. He isn't the worst teacher and you probably can't avoid him anyways.
He is a grezt person and a great teacher!
Good Teacher, knows his stuff
The is one entertaining professor.  Hard classes but learn alot. Really cares.
Lots of cool stories, loves his work, enthusiastic, really cares.
He is OK
He is arguably the best lecturer in the Business College. He is very interesting and his voice is loud enough to be heard at the other end of the hall if the door is open!
BLAH
Pretty picky on essays and talks a little too fast...but an interesting man who knows his stuff.
Dr. Banfe teaches you very well and tells great stories.
One of a kind.
Very interesting man, tells very good stories, doesn't teach very much, but knows how to keep your attention. An overall enjoyable experience.
One of my favorite professors.  Witty, intelligent, and always willing to share an outragious story. Great at communicating and wonderful to talk to.  A+++++++++++++++.
Really enjoyed his class. Has been everywhere, done everything. Cares.
Keeps you thinking
incredible. the man",The is one entertaining professor.  Hard classes but learn alot. Really cares.
348,"Professor Putt is a pretty good teacher. He explains things well. Attendence is mandatory because he has random short quizzes. Although he is a good professor his class is quite difficult.
Professor Putt is an excellent professor, he explains topics clearly, gives good in class examples, and frequently offers to walk through homework problems. He mainly assigns odd numbered problems, making it easier to check your own work from the book.
Oh Harold! I took AP Calc in high school, but the stuff I didn't get then, I get now thanks to Putt. He's so nice and funny! However, YOU MUST GO TO CLASS b/c there is a 5 point, one question quiz EVERYDAY. They're easy and pad your grade! If you can get his old tests, do it! They're pretty much identical as far as the type of problem. Awesome!
if you go to class and listen somewhat you should do fine. he will explain the material very well and you answer a question for 5 points every class. he takes your top 2/3 quesions for your in-class grade. then you have 2 tests and a final. no surprises. great professor, even better guy.
Best math teacher ever
Great guy who really loves what he is doing. Somedays he seems like he is going to jump up and down because he is so excited about a concept. He can get a bit lengthy, it is math, so it isn't that exciting. Class is tough, but easy at the same time. He gives review sessions and has plenty of class and office time to answer questions.
Wish all profs were like him. Great at explaining everything and preparing you for what will be on tests. Holds review sessions and covers everything to prepare you for tests.
He's the nicest guy ever and extremely helpful.  He explains everything very well.  His tests and quizes are very fair too.
He is a great guy and he is willing to help you!!Class is ok, but if you ask questions and be attentive you will be fine!!!
Good teacher, but he will put you to SLEEP! Make sure you have some caffine before going to his class
Nice guy willing to go out of his way to help.  Class can be a bit boring and sometimes the eyes get a little heavy.
great prof, just do the hw and you will be fine, make sure you read, the tests are usually 20% mc, from the reading.  and just so you know, reading about stats is less interesting than doing it.  if you get in trouble ask for help, he'll go out of his way for you
This class was real easy.  Bombed stuff late in the quarter then aced the final.  Class was helpful even though I kinda didn't try too hard until late in the quarter.
Good teacher, willing to help, you'll know what to expect.
Very nice guy.  Always willing to help, but still expects you to do your part.
should not be teaching
Average
A very easy to understand calc professor.  Also a nice fellow.  Take him and you won't go wrong.","He is a great guy and he is willing to help you!!Class is ok, but if you ask questions and be attentive you will be fine!!!"
349,"I had Dr Bowerman for 3 Stats courses in 1976-77.  As I recall he was an energetic, funny and helpful teacher. He engaged students in good discussions.  Loved his classes.  Didn't wear a winter coat, always on time.  His teaching helped me land my first job.
Awesome
Loved him.  He made my first semester wonderful.
funny guy
Probably the funniest teacher I have ever had! He has a thyroid problem, so he has to wear winter jackets ALL the time...but that is waht makes him so loveable. He is a great teacher though. He wrote the book, so he knows what he is talking about. He makes you come to class, but it really helps if you are there. Definite A if you pat attention.
Hilarious old man. One of best teachers I've had.
Makes you go to class everyday for you to hear himself talking. Yes, after he gets into class 15 minutes late it's lights out 5 minutes later. Final is tough, midterms are easy. B extremely easy ot get A is attainable if you do well on the final.  All DSC teachers are terrible so he's ok for DSC
Nice old Guy. Dresses like an arctic explorer on 95 degree days. Shows up at least 15 minutes late to every class. Hates grading, so is very easy and a guaranteed A if u try just a little.
Hilarious in a strange way.  Cute little old man that knows way too much about stats, but easy course.
Crazy, funny, and a great teacher. He is great at explaining the material.
Hilarious, his health is failing though... hates giving grades and is easy grader.
Although is attire can be shocking...he is really funny!  Pretty easy too!
He is halarious...  He is pretty easy.. Got An A in his Class!!!
EXTREMELY funny and nice. Can use any notes for tests. Class not time consuming.",Although is attire can be shocking...he is really funny!  Pretty easy too!
351,"I adored Dr. Smith. He is an incredibly smart, nice, and caring professor. The course consists of three exams and two essays, and that's it. The only criticism I have of him is he is quite monotoned. I really recommend taking Mack. I very much enjoyed his class.
Very nice guy, but has some flaws as a professor. He talks so softly that it's hard to hear him, even when sitting in the front row; uses ""ummm"" A LOT; very bad with returning grades in a timely fashion. He does know his stuff though, and he is helpful!
I love Dr. Smith. He is an intelligant, kind, caring professor. Two papers and three tests, and wa-la. He is soft spoken though. I would HIGHLY recommend taking him, I thoroughly enjoyed the course.
There is a lot of required reading, but you're probably an English major so get used to it.  I missed a few readings and still ace every exam.  Just listen to what he says, nothing not reviewed is going to be on the exam.  He is probably one of the sweetest guys at GVSU.  I love Prof. Smith.
People complain about him being too hard to understand but I find that if you READ THE FRIKKIN' TEXTS it won't be so hard! I hear people saying how they Sparknoted this or that story and if they do that they cannot answer the questions Dr.Smith asks. He is very, very smart and I have learned so much from him! I'd take him again!!
He is suuuper dull, soft spoken and mono tone, says ummmmmmmmmm every sentence which makes it so hard to be interested or even pay attention to what he's saying. you read 5 novels which is ridiculous but some are actually interesting, 2 five page papers-he's picky on grammer/structure being an english prof, and 2 exams..fairly easy grader though
I found he was very open to student interpretations, as long as they were well thought out. I often had a difference of a opinion with him. He quite often would use words like ""Brilliant"" when students came up with something new. He gave points for originality.
Professor Smith was a very good teacher. He knows a TON about the biographies behind the authors we read, which often illuminate the text to a whole new level. He is quiet, but only hard to hear when fools in class are chattering. Easily aced his tests, just paid attention. Grades papers pretty softly, not much nit-picking on grammar (thank god).
Although Prof Smith is quite smart, I find myself lulled to sleep almost everyday in his class- and I love English! But this class was not only bland in the reading material, but extremely hard in the tests and essays! I felt bored most of the time and frustrated other times.
to the people who bashed on mack; not all interpretations to literature are correct, so if u are wrong he will tell you. His level of analysis is clearly deeper than students but helps class reach that level. He is a genius and a great prof
a brilliant mind- great prof, easy grader on tests.
He is hard to listen for a whole semester. He talks too soft and is monotone. There is not much work. 2 papers and 3 exams and discussion board each class day. His exams are hard because they are all based on what he says in class. There is too much to remember on exams. The first exam isn't bad but then the others are horrible. Take someone else.
Mack Smith is one of the best English professors at Grand Valley. He is a genius, and he asks challenging questions that help students to really think. He also very witty and has a dry sense of humor. Was not afraid to get off topic when discussion was interesting. He was very helpful and somewhat easy. Just an all around great person.
What is that mellifluous noise?  ...Why, the sound of my own voice!  This is made doubly bad by the fact that he's so quiet that everyone else can't hear this enchanting sound.  Worst English prof I've had at GV. Actually tells students ""No, I don't think so"" when they're trying to offer insight.  People gave up speaking in my class after week two.
pretty easy theme course, there were 6 books to read, but they were quick and easy.  2 essays, both pretty simple too.  His exams are 45 short answer questions, but he doesnt mark the 5 first you get wrong, so its easy to still get an A.  If youre looking for an easy theme course, this is it.
Loves to hear himself speak.  Does not allow any room for interpretation.  His way or the wrong way - even though oftentimes his way IS the wrong way.  Tests are too easy, papers ok, but all this is only if you turn off your brain and write down everything he says in class.  Will never take this prof again.
This Prof is awesome!  He assigned a lot of reading, but I guess that's what to expect from a literature class, but in the end, our class asked him to make our final exam an open note exam, so if you take good notes in his class, see if you get him to do the same!  He never had any other exams or tests in his class besides the final.  His exam was extremely easy as long as you had the notes to follow.  He had a very soothing voice too, so be careful not to fall asleep!!
Terrible!  Loves to hear himself talk, but so soft spoken you can't hear.  Would never take him again.
Wonderful and knowledgable prof. Tends to lecture but if you're interested in the class it will be a breeze! Very understanding, lets you correct wrong questions on tests to habd in for full points! I loved him and would take him over and over again!
Very softspoken!!! Rarely writes notes on the board even though he tests you on them. Exams and papers are on the easy side, but lecture is hard to sit through. Does not know how to communicate effectively and hates being interrupted by students.","Professor Smith was a very good teacher.

352,"I had her for speech online, theres 5 main speeches and you have to complete 20 connect tests by the end of the semester. Shes really helpful when it comes to developing your speeches and gives you the tools you need to pass!
Online quizzes throughout the semester with a final paper. Ann was so funny and never made you feel discouraged even if you gave a wrong or obscure answer. She always found a way to build off it and use other's ideas to gain understanding for the overall group. Work in ""pods"" throughout semester, if you have her as a 6-9, you will get out early.
One of my favorite profs at GVSU. Class wasn't super mandatory and I still went to class everyday because I just loved hearing her talk! She has the best advice and was so funny! She really does an amazing job teaching things that students actually enjoy learning about and she did it in a fun way! Loved her soo much!! Highly recommend!
Ann is awesome! She is hilarious. Our grade was based on 30 online tests through Connect, which you have access to the book and the internet for. I love her real life stories that connects the material to real life. If you're looking for a really easy-going professor, a good grade, and some new knowledge. Definitely take her!
You will never be bored in Ann's class. She is energetic, funny, and so entertaining to listen to. However, exams are not always consistent with what's talked about in class.  In class discussions are more for fun than to prepare for exam, therefore much of the learning I did for this course was done outside of class from outline.
She is soooooo funny! (If you take this class you'll understand the reference). I enjoyed her stories and examples of metaphors far more than the textbook content.  She's sassy, open-minded,  and not afraid to express herself which is great for keeping your attention. This ENTIRE class is based off of metaphors. For an easy A, take this class.
Professor Byar's class was a lot of fun. She gives many great examples to go along the text. There's barely any homework and three tests during the semester. Absolutely recommend.
She's really awesome, laid back, understand and funny. However, she really likes to hear herself talk....I felt like I was at a Stand Up Comedian show, but not in the good way. She often just rambles on and on about simple concepts. Her class is really fun, especially for a COM 101, but just know she talks A LOT.
Great teacher 
Her classes were very entertaining, but I feel like I did not learn much at all. If you want something more challenging, don't take her. She's funny and her lectures are interesting, but I feel like they are more suitable for high school students than college students. 
She is very easy going and made a class like speech, which can be extremely stressful for some people, very fun. I hated speaking in public, now I'm way more confident She gave a very clear instructions and examples of how to write and present a speech.If you have to take speech, take it with her!
Rude, mean, very self-absorbed,obviously doesn't want to be teaching and let's the class know it.
She tells really good stories. She's nice and teaches the material well. No need to read the text. She goes over it every class period. She gives reviews for every test.
Professor Byars is awesome!! She lectures out of the book and doesn't use powerpoints so be prepared to take notes. She has a great sense of humor and keeps class fun. Tests are easy and she gives a study guide which will have everything on the test. Class isn't challenging but it's a 100 level. Definitely recommend taking her!
She is hilarious and knowledgeable about the subject. My only complaint was that it was too easy because there was no real challenge, just a lot of insightful tips for communicating in the professional world. She has a great personality and I suggest taking her.
This class is more like the Ann Byars comedy hour, but that's not a bad thing. She keeps the material fresh and funny and has a lot of interesting out of text information. The class went downhill a bit during the semester, but it was still a lot better than my friends COM 101 class with a different professor!
Awesome prof.  Has a plethora of real world knowledge that she incorporates into her lectures. Keeps lectures to the point and offers real world examples.
amazing teacher with a great personality. will be looking for her the next time i pick my classes. helps with anything you need. best comm teacher out there.
She is one of the main reasons I graduated on time. I had her for COM295 & COM495 during my last semester, while also taking 4 production photography courses including my senior thesis. Had she not been clear and helpful I never would have been able to balance my load. You could say I got really lucky!
By far the most useful Prof. I had at GV! I continue to email with Ann on occasion when I have life questions. ie. What should I wear to a breakfast meeting, what should I order, when should I look in to starting an IRA? She was amazing and I would have taken her class multiple times. (I had her for COM295 and COM495)",Professor Byars is awesome!! She lectures out of the book and doesn't use powerpoints so be prepared to take notes.

353,"I am so glad this class is over with because I regret taking it with this professor. She is condescending, her instructions can be vague and unclear, and it seems like she is more than willing to hand out 0's . When you ask questions, be prepared for a condescending overtone in response. Although I did well, I noticed too many others didn't.
If you show up and take notes then you should be fine. I didn't have to write any papers, we just had tests and presentations. She is nit-picky but she's not too bad. She's really interested in what she is teaching and I learned a lot from the class.
Previous comments are completely irrelevant. Go to class and take good notes (she writes everything on the board), and provided you put in at least 5 hrs studying time, you'll do well. This class isn't difficult and Dr. Smith is very helpful!
Took amazing notes and attended every lecture but still got a D on my first exam. Her grading is ridiculous and she focuses on miniscule details rather than important topics. Prepare to work HARD and study for hours on end or don't take this class
hardest class of my life
Her class is impossible. I spent SO much time studying for the final..read over material inside and out & still failed it. She teaches a 100 level course as if she were teaching a 400 level course. we don't know everything about geog. and if we did we obviously wouldnt be taking your class!! Its like she wants you to fail
do NOT take. I read the book, came to class, took LOTS of notes, met with her during office hours about the paper(which was almost impossible to write)& about how to improve my grade and STILL got a D+ in her class. There are things on her tests that havent been taught and the way she words her questions are confusing. stay away AT ALL COSTS!!!
Wow, through class you seem like you know the info taking notes. You go to study for the test and read the chapters, make notecards from the books and your notes. Then on the tests are tiny details from the book that have little or nothing to do with what was learned in class.  Test us on what we learned, not random facts! Stay away from this class
The class was ridiculous. Her exams were very opinionated and when grading the essays we had to write, on a topic we could not choose, she focused way too much on grammar. I thought I was taking geography. Don't take this class.
worst teacher ever. has no understanding for her students and seems to pick attitudes if things are done her way. her lectures are NOTHING like her exams. she automatically assumes you have history/geog. backgrounds. and her projects = useless. AWFUL. PLEASE AVOID!!!!
She was really nice & quite clear with the lecture. She wrote all the important stuff on the board & while her method of doing group projects is wierd, overall I really was happy I took her.  Took her over winter, and she sounds soo much better than the prof that teaches Fall/Spring (Veness I think).  Take her if you need the class!
Comes across very cold. Difficult exams. Most students have her early (fresh/soph year) and she is DEMANDING - be prepared to WORK. Will help if approached. In my opinion she is too touch on her students for the type of material taught - I have seen much better approaches. Suggest u find another sec
Goodness she's not that bad.  She will help you if you ask her - I liked the class and she helped me to get through it.
Had her for both 207 & 208.  If you memorized everything in your notes you did fine. I  applied for an internship after freshman yr and she was the only bio prof I had and she wouldn't write a reference for me.  She's doesn't seem to care about students.
BOO! IF you take this class u may want to pawn a gun.  FIRE HER!
i think she hates her students. needs to find a new job. AVOID (even if required) drop outta school!",Comes across very cold. Difficult exams.

357,"Milt is easily one of the nicest people you will meet. He loves what he does and it shows in every class. He doesn't lecture, he discusses topics and encourages participation from students. He really cares that students learn and enjoy themselves and do well. Sometimes class can get boring- but that's because no one's talking! Take him if you can!!
He is a very nice man. This class is a learning and keeping an open mind class. There are readings from 3 different books, no exams. Mid term is a discussion presentation and the final is a paper. He is very helpful if you don't understand. This is a great class, for our world today!
Professor Ford is a very sweet man. He clearly values all opinions and comments during class discussions. There are no exams whatsoever--just journal entries for short stories, a research paper, and source cards/notecards. The class itself is a safe environment for everyone, and you'll leave the class feeling more enlightened also.
Milt is one of THE BEST professors that grand valley has! he is fun and interesting and interacts well with his students. He always takes your opinion into account and I promise you you will walk out more educated than you went in!
Super easy class and professor. All discussion, easiest homework in the world. Class discussions are interesting and all view points are welcome. You actually learn in this class because it's an interesting topic and it's fun stuff to learn. Plus you watch movies during class times when your not discussing.
Milt is super nice and funny and kind. He is not very difficult. He likes to have the students lead discussions and basically it?s all about discussing. I would recommend him, very sweet man.
Easy class nice prof and very informative. Makes you think about a lot of issues that are commonly overlooked in todays world. I found it to be a very enlightening an enjoyable experience. No tests or quizzes. Just one big paper and some journals to go along with the reading. my only negative comment is that some of the reading was very.. graphic.
He's a cute old southern man and he's really easy to talk to. The course was pretty easy and the discussions were always interesting. You definitely meet a lot of really cool people and learn a lot from Ford's class. Take him!
Being a heterosexual individual in a class full of mostly homosexuals, I learned a lot about a homosexual lifestyle. This class did not make me feel uncomfortable, but informed me on issues related to the topic. I really enjoyed this class. It is a great class for future educators or people who are interested in a understanding LGBT
This was a class that sounded interested and I wanted to take it. Milt is a good professor that can relate to the topic. This helps because he is able to give experience in the topic.
HE IS GREAT ! Class is super easy except for the JOURNALS those are kind of annoying.
Milt was great! Super easy- lots of writing (a journal for every class but they're only a page) and a 6-8 pg paper, No midterm/final- just journals. You will watch a lot of movies, but they are interesting. very nice, highly recommended!
Milt was great!  The class readings were a little dry, lecture was sort of dull, but he was such a nice man.  Super easy- lots of writing (a journal for everything you read) and a 6-8 pg paper, but it could've been a lot worse. No midterm/final- just journals. Take Milt!!
Very nice, not much structure to class, just write in your jounals, and your assignments.  You will watch  a lot of movies, but they are interesting.  very nice, highly recommended
He's very nice. He taught my class out of experience more than teaching skill, but that was okay. He was a little vague, but that was more because he wants the students to take the concept of the assignment and be creative with it. He's a lenient grader, and also flexible with deadlines and time frames. Perfect for senior year students.
He's a great professor, take him for this class, the other professors are really hard.  He teaches using 3 short exams, 2 projects, and 2 papers.  The material is boring, but it was fun to learn how to transcribe sentences linguistically.  Take this class when you have a bunch of other hard classes.
Prof Ford is an awsome teacher. A little boring at times, but he tends to do projects instead of tests. Seems to genuinly care about the students, and is always willing to help
Such an easy class but so boring. Come to class and pay some attention and you'll be just fine. He's a nice guy and a great teacher, it's just dry material. This is probably a good class to take in a S/S semester cuz it's short!
He really gives his students a break, but I learned so much from him about linguistics. Lecture was a little dry but the papers and tests were very easy and worth suffering through the lecture.  If you want a realaxed class, to learn a lot and still keep your GPA, take Ford.  Ford for President!!!!!
Milt Ford is the nicest teacher you could ever possibly have. Just pay some attention, do some readings, participate and learn a little something, and you will do well.","Milt was great!  The class readings were a little dry, lecture was sort of dull, but he was such a nice "
359,"Super fun prof! The content was really cool, and he was a fun prof to learn it from. He's chill, not too much busy work, interesting lectures, offers lots of extra content (songs, movies, articles) if you want to learn more. Assignments were all productive and helpful, and great feedback.
Daniel Golembeski is such a good person. Hes an excellent professor, hes very good at teaching difficult material. Hes also just super sweet.
He curves half the tests which proves that the class learns nothing. If you want to learn something, do not take this class with this teacher. He reads directly off of the slides and doesn't explain any concepts. I resorted to google to teach MDLS.
Prof. Golembeski was a great professor who really cared a lot about his students and their success in his class .He gave a lot of opportunities to do well and though there was a lot of homework, it was very helpful because it helped with the understanding of the course work.
Dan was my favorite professor this semester, and I definitely recommend taking his class! He's really laid-back, and you can tell he loves what he does. As long as you participate and make sure to study the content, you'll be fine. This class was actually a stress-reliever for me most of the time and I looked forward to the lectures.
Golembeski is so easy to like! He has funny stories and easy to get along with. His love for French is contagious. He loves participation, so you need to participate as much as possible! Hes also very understanding so dont be afraid to talk to him.
Very easy class his lectures arent the best but if you pay attention and study what you are supposed to you should have no problems with this class
I think he's a little disorganized, but means well. Prof. is super nice and helpful if you're having trouble. I probably spent maybe an hour a week total outside of class for homework. Doesn't use the textbook very often, but there are several presentations. Likes to assign last minute assignments on blackboard but never checks them. 
Such a good prof!! Absolutely loves French and is always willing to work with students if they have questions. He is very funny and makes class enjoyable! Genuinely cares for his students and is a very understanding person! I HIGHLY recommend taking him whenever possible!!
Dan is awesome! One of the best professors out there. He is super willing to help his students and his love of French is infectious. Can't wait to take more of his classes.
Great class, great prof.  Some subjects get a little old, but if you try you will get a good grade.
A little disorganized at times, but totally invested in French as a subject and lifestyle, as well as his students as individuals. Really laid back and very flexible. The nicest guy ever, and really funny.
He's so nice and easy to talk to, class went by so fast. It's a nice, comfortable environment which makes speaking in French easier. Take him if you can!
I had him from beginning to end and we had a blast in France hiking up the hills and getting lost.  He doesn't just teach french, he lives it.  He's a great prof and his teaching techniques depends on the class. I hated phonetics and text book was used a lot, but he was always there for us.  I miss him as my prof and my friend. Highly reccommend.
outrageous
Rock it baby!
ok
He's a funny guy, very helpful and nice. Kinda confusing at times but always straightens things out, and he's a little bit harsh on the grading. The poems and songs are ok i guess... He's a good prof though, and I learned a lot.
I loved him. He was so funny. The class was not that bad if you put some effort in. The poetry stuff kind of sucked...but I really liked the class. It almost made me like french. :)
I loved this professor! Not only is he funny and the sweetest guy, he knows A TON. He's very understanding and will always help with any questions. Take him! You won't be sorry!","A little disorganized at times, but totally invested in French as a subject and lifestyle, as well as his students as individuals. Really laid back and very flexible.

360,"This class makes me think what in the heck is the lib studies dpt doing. every class I have had in this dept had made me think at a third graders level. I have never been so bored with busy work in my life. I dread going to class and doing assignments because they are so stupid. Also, didnt read a singal assn and still passed.....
For a liberal studies professor she has a very conservative view of education and leadership. Doesn't understand the world students will be working in, only the one she has. Dropped after four and a half weeks.
I loved all my liberal studies courses until this one.  It's a shame because you expect your senior capstone to be the best class you take.  Prof. Whipps an average grader and not an exceptionally great lecturer.  I felt like the culmination of my previous classes went unused as we had a very unclear thesis requirements that did not fit with mine.
Dr Whipps can be a little difficult to hear as she speaks softly but her words carry a lot of weight.  Assignments every week lots of classroom group interaction, if you are shy you will need to get over it because you will be talking to classmates often.  Take Lib 301 BEFORE you take lib495 and start working on your research paper.
I did not care for the class. She sold students on the major the entire semester. This made me realize that Lib. Studies was not for me. Clearly, there is a complex and apprehension for the professor to feel the need to sell Liberal education. She does grade really easy but the class is alot of work. I didn't like her or her class
Took lib 401 as a Gen Ed, and the class itself was kind of boring, but then again I wasnt very interested to start with. I have yet to really buy into the whole liberal education thing, but whipps really knows her stuff and gives a manageable workload. If you have to take 401, Whipps is a good choice.
Had to take this as a theme course(gen-ed)  She is very helpful and nice, not a lot of pressure and she helped me to think critically.  It's a shame I really had no interest in the subject matter, cause I hated comming to class- but I recommend her as a prof
Great Professor, she has been one of the best teachers i have had at grand valley. She truly cares about her students and respects them all! There are a lot of papers but her true intentions are to get you out in the real world and ready!!
Super nice teacher, if you talk to her at all she's very willing to help you at any time. Not very strict about anything except attendance. The class is a big waste of time, however, so attendance is difficult.
She is a great prof. i would definately recommend her. she sincerely is concerned with all of her studentd learning and understanding, and she is very easy to talk to. She helps students with their sense of vocation and truly encourages discussion and sharing your thoughts. The classroom community is very relaxed and you get so many of life concept
she's a great teacher. she brought things to my attention i couldn't previously imagine or comprehend. Although there is some work to do for this class, it does really further your understanding and appreciation of learning and life :)
She's really friendly, good sense of humor, and full of wisdom.
very hard for a 100 course.She was passionate about what she was teaching but if i learned anything it would have to be better writing skills b/c i wrote 11 papers. She wrote the opener for the text you use in class and was also an editor so shes big shot. Be ready to WORK if you take her..
What most people fail to realize here, is her passion for learning. She tries to get you to realize how important a liberal education is, rather than trying to fill you with info just to sit in a cubicle for the rest of your life...Like Socrates once said, ""An unexamined life isn't worth living.""
HARD!!!! great thinker, but very hard if you dont understand philosophy
Don't listen to the fools, Dr Whipps is fantastic. One of the most helpful, concerned, and intelligent people at GV. She'll make you work, but that's what you're in school for.
Condecending-she is an expert in philosophy and what not, but talks as if she were all knowing and everyone else knows NOTHING. She is open to opinions in class but if they agree with hers. Fairly nice and approachable...but like I said, can be  very condecending.
She's awful. The class, which COULD have been interesting, was just tedious. If you take her class, you'd better not have an opinion unless it is the same as her's. She does not know the meaning of the word opinion. She's the worst professor I've ever had at Grand Valley.
This course demands a tremendous amount of reading. You'll have read several novels at its end. It is clear that Whipps assigns too much material, as many students only have a tenuous grasp. Overall, the course is frustrating but it does have its moments of interest.
Worst class I've had in four years of College. If your papers don't support her opinions she will fail you. Stay away at all costs.","Dr Whipps can be a little difficult to hear as she speaks softly but her words carry a lot of weight.

362,"Wonderful professors. His lectures are required. If you don't attend you wont pass. But they are amazing. His lectures were the best part of my week. He knows a lot. And wants you to know too. I feel like I left this class with a new perspective. I recommend this professor to anyone. He goes above and beyond and is hilarious. Never a dull moment.
Such a sweet professor! Literally all you have to do it get a good grade is take notes during lectures. Exams are take-home and he usually gives about a week to do them. 
Professor Pestana is a great professor. If you attend classes and give even medium effort you will pass this class with ease. Professor Pestana takes a lot of time of each topic and gives lots of great examples. He also cares for all of his students. Often we would do homework and quizzes in class. He will take time to help any student. 
Rly good guy, but the way he explains stuff is way more confusing than it needs to be. The content is difficult, but once you get it it really clicks. Take note of everything he says so u can refer back to it. Material is kinda dry and repetitive but the class is abt analyzing ways of thinking & Im a psych major so it was interesting to me at least
Prof Pestana understands that logic is confusing and he always says it's a bunch of ""Gobbly-gook"", so he tries his best to break it down and explain it step by step which I find very helpful. There are 10 assignments that are just due by the end of sem, and 4 quizzes, 2 exams. This class is not easy, but if you pay attention you can do it.
Don't let your advisor tell you that this is an easy substitute for a math class. THIS IS HARDDD. Very lecture heavy and Professor Pestana is really hard to follow at times, he also kind of talks slow but even then he's hard to follow because he's just everywhere and is kind of a tough grader. He also says BONK a lot and I love it.
Prof Pestana is great. Logic did not come easy to me, and I struggled in the course, but he takes your work ethic into account when he grades. Show up, ask for help, and he will remember that. Review the textbook, it helps a lot. Finding others to study with is also a good idea. Ask questions.
If you don't choose Pestana for PHI 102 you are making a huge mistake
Pestana is seriously great. I've had him for several classes and he never disappoints. His lectures are interesting and he never fails to throw in a few lame (yet hilarious) jokes. He is so lenient with grading and makes class a breeze. 100% recommend.
Class is never boring with Dr. Pestana, that's for sure. He goes off on tangents but it somehow always relates back to the subject matter. Exams and assignments were challenging but in a good way. You won't even want to skip class! I really enjoyed his class, the man is brilliant. Take a class with Dr. Pestana if you can.
It's no lie that the course material is down right confusing. However, Pestana is very passionate about what he does and tries to make the material understandable. He provides many examples and answers on how to solve problems. Quizzes are all take home and you can submit late work. But it's a class you don't really want to skip!
He's a really good professor! It becomes obvious very quickly that he's passionate about what he's teaching, and that automatically makes the class interesting. There's a couple papers, and the homework is to just read, but I never really did and passed without a problem.
Professor Pestana is a very nice man and he tries to make class easy. All quizzes and tests were take home and you can always submit homework late. The class is somewhat difficult but he does a good job at mitigating the difficulty.
Professor Pestana was a really cool guy who is always willing to help his students. The class is all lectures and the notes can get a little crazy. There's three take home exams and a final paper. Attendance isn't mandatory but the more you show up the better. Philosophy isn't exactly easy for everyone but Professor Pestana makes it easier.
Pestana is probably my favorite professor. Nice guy, very understanding and lenient, doesn't screw you over on grading. Lectures were always interesting, engaging, and funny. He's passionate about what he teaches and it makes it genuinely fun. I looked forward to his class.
Pestana is an extremely wise man. He knows exactly what he's talking about. He's funny and makes lectures as interesting as he can. I had trouble in the beginning with the material and he made accommodations to make sure I'd succeed in the class. He genuinely cares about his students and their experience in his class. I highly recommend taking him
If you're looking for easiness, he's not your guy. Class is tough, but if you come to class and pay attention you'll do fine on the quizzes. I found the midterm and final to be the easiest out of them all actually. Pretty vibrant lecturer, it's hard to not pay attention when he's teaching. Probably the funniest prof I've ever had too.
Professor Pestana is a really nice and funny man. However, this class is insanely hard. It is unclear what he wants on his 5 quizzes and those are the only grades the entire semester. Doesn't post anything on blackboard and if you skip class you missed a whole lecture because everyday he hand writes notes on the board. Nice man but had material.
Professor Pestana knows so freakin' much. He's able to bring in references from ancient, medieval, modern, and contemporary philosophy-- in addition to psychology and physics-- all while staying on topic and very informative.  If you pay very close attention, you will get so much out of his class.
Pestana is hilarious and makes class interesting. But, he's super disorganized and you'll only be able to read the first two letters of every word he writes. Very knowledgeable and I learned more than I thought I would. Tests are essays. Pay attention and write some stuff down and you'll be golden. He's super passionate about philosophy too.",Pestana is an extremely wise man. He knows exactly what he's talking about. He's funny and makes lectures as interesting as he can.

364,"Never set up a blackboard, never got a syllabus, never had a Zoom meeting, claimed everything he created was somehow deleted by BB?? Would only teach by email. Then we get an email after 2 months from the English department that he is being replaced for the course, and he sends an email about his retirement, don't know if that's true. ??? sus
He rambles, but is very knowledgeable on many, many topics. Paper topics can be confusing, but you can write anything and you'll get an A. Lectures are usually boring. I don't think anyone reads the book, you don't really need it. If you're looking for an easy class with a nice prof, this is it. Don't take this if you're interested in world myth.
The class is very easy, show up & get an A. There are 3 papers throughout the semester and he gives A's on all of them. He can get off track, but he has experienced many things and can add humor to anything. He is always very happy and truly cares about his students. If you want an easy class and you don't care about actually learning, take him.
Super nice guy. That being said, it is SO boring. I learned basically nothing about mythology and dreaded going to class because it was so hard to sit through. Easy A, only 3 papers and no homework. Attendance isn't mandatory. Take if you want an easy way out, do NOT take if you want an engaging class.
I went an entire semester in Ivo's World Mythology course, and never learned a single thing about mythology. He stands in front of the class and talks about whatever pops into his head. Nice and charismatic guy, but it became hard to make myself show up, as I knew it would be just another day of random tangents.
He doesn't use Blackboard at all, rarely uses his emails (it's a struggle to get in contact at all), and his syllabus has next to no information that is needed, ESPECIALLY the Final Exam (a paper) and when it's due. He calls people out just on the way they dress, doesn't really give a crap about his class, and doesn't like showing up on time ever.
if you've ever watched My Big Fat Greek Wedding, he is the father from that movie. Most classes he tells you the root of words. Not mandatory but he takes attendance and will eventually ask you to start coming. Graded on 3 papers that every one gets an A on. Doesn't set up blackboard and comes 15 minutes late to every class. The funniest emailer.
He's crazy but amusing. Don't bother doing the reading because you never talk about it and he tells you what evidence to use in your papers. I took him as a 6-9 and just worked on other class stuff on my laptop the whole time while he rambled incoherently. Also, it takes months to get your papers back.
If you are looking for an easy A, this class is it. There were 3 papers we had to write, he says at the beginning that there are 5 but he pushes dates back and you only get through the first 3. If you meet the requirements on them and try just a little bit you will pass with most likely an A.
Just a warning, he doesn't use blackboard at all. Doesn't even bother to set it up. Definitely takes attendance, but is never on time for class. His lectures are very hard to follow as he goes on tangents quite often, so my advice if you take him is to keep all papers he passes out and just use sparknotes and you'll be fine!
I loved Dr. Soljan as a person, but I hated being in his class. I dreaded going to class because it was so unstructured and hard to follow what was going on. The only grades were 3 papers that everyone seemed to get an A on, which was nice, but I do not feel like I have learned anything about mythology overall. Class was not worth my time or money.
He is a really interesting professor. Classes are spent reading the pieces so you really don't have to read out of class and there is no participation necessary. He doesn't use BB which is annoying cause you don't know how you're doing. He is a really nice guy though and you only write 3 papers. That's your grade right there.
Ivo was wonderful! You can tell he truly loves what he does and has a passion for teaching. His lectures are tangents but they literally always connect, and if you pay attention you could learn a great deal about life. He is so understanding, just go talk with him about it! I bought the text book an never used it, just use google Graded by 2 papers
Good news: He's an easy grader, and you can miss class without it being a big deal. Bad news: He never uses Blackboard, you aren't given a syllabus, and there is absolutely no class discussion (it's all lecture). My advice: Put some effort into the three papers, and it's an easy A.
This class was by no means difficult. He gives three absences until grade deductions occur, but you can write a formal letter to have them adjusted baring a good reason. The lectures do drone on, but show up and act like you care and it'll benefit you. He let me turn in my paper two weeks late because I explained my situation and showed him respect
Currently in this class and regret taking it. If you miss a day you have to write an ""apology letter;"" he gets really butt hurt. Doesn't use blackboard. When he ""teaches"" its just him going off on a tangent about a random subject not related to mythology. I am usually good in class but not this one. Do yourself a favor and take someone else.
Dr. Soljan is a wonderful professor. Give great feedback on papers, doesn't give tons of homework and he genuinely cares about his students and their well being. You can tell that he has a passion for teaching and the subjects. His lectures as long, but very interesting and he's hilarious! I highly recommend him!
Goes off on tangents. Hard to connect lecture to papers he requires. Spark notes are more helpful for writing the papers. If you've had humanities 101 there isn't anything new here.
Overall Ivo is a great guy, but I didn't learn anything in the class. Easy A, but he goes off in his own little world half the time so I spent my time in the class drawing. He assigns papers that may seem daunting, but just spark note the readings and you'll get the info and A's on your papers.
Professor Soljan is kinda boring. He takes a long time to discuss one piece of literature and wanders from the topic a lot. For an SWS class, it was low on writing; there are only 3 papers and the last one counts as the final. He is understanding but very opinionated. Show up to class and you will pass.",He is a really interesting professor. Classes are spent reading the pieces so you really don't have to read out of class and there is no participation necessary.

366,"attending the lectures was completely useless, I learned more by watching youtube videos and documentaries about Russian history than I did in his class. He deosn't involve the class at all, just talks, and talks, and talks for an hour ad half straight about everything you just read.
Professor Cole is an amazing teacher. He knows absolutely everything about history, so if you need clarification, don't hesitate to ask. He speaks slightly monotonously, but if you listen to what he's saying, it's really interesting. If you take good notes, you can answer any of his assigned questions, which are few.
He is such a sweetheart; his feigned obliviousness to his wife's funny, pretend nagging makes the class even more interesting. Whenever he comes in he enters with a tux, a bowtie and sunglasses and it's the funniest thing in the world to see him smile widely up in front of class, obviously enraptured by the subject he teaches.
Sweet old man
Professor Cole has extremely long and boring lectures. He doesn't use a powerpoint or outline or anything so it's really hard to follow. He writes occasional words on the board and expects you to understand. It's hard to stay awake, let alone learn anything. He doesn't expect too much though - just a few papers. Fairly easy - just boring.
Professor Cole is a very nice man, however his lectures in class do not related to the exams AT ALL! You are required to do much research outside of class to find answers for his exam questions (owls) and you never know if they are right. He is very smart but you will not learn much from the class.
Very knowledgeable about the subject however he does not teach this class well.Lectures do not have much to do with exams and the exams are really hard.Also he is super unorganized and you have no idea what your grade is until you get your final grade. Nice guy, but not that good of a teacher.
It's a shame that kids looking for an easy A bring down Dr. Cole's grade. He is the best history professor GVSU has on staff. Cole is brilliant, and really a diamond in the rough here. Take him if you're in college to actually learn something or better yourself.
He is a very nice guy but is not a good teacher. He is super knowledgeable and there is little work required for this class.The exams are impossible and even though they are a scan tron it takes him about two months to get them back and you just get to see your grade.Also it is nearly impossible to get an A.If you want a good grade do not take him.
Had him for European history. Probably the worst setup class I've ever taken. He lectures about the most random things in class and everything he says is useless when trying to study. The guy is hilarious, take him if your a history genius. If not, steer clear. He's late, never gives work back on time, and is just not a very good prof.
Attendance is not mandatory, but you should go. Quizzes over nightly readings. He's got great stories and makes the class interesting. He's hard, but worth it. AMAZING professor.
Very intelligent professor. Knows everything off the top of his head, so don't hesitate to ask a question. Lecture is long and can get dull, but don't fall behind in the reading or you're screwed. He may fall off-topic and sometimes makes a mess on the board which can be hard to follow, but he will get to the point in the end.
He is the sweetest man in the world! If you take anyone else for history, you're missing out! He has all sorts of stories and hilariously awful drawings, but he still covers the material adequately and clearly, doesn't ramble irrelevantly. Just do the readings, attend regularly, keep up to date on the OWLS and you'll be fine. HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM!
Cole and Rydel make a wonderful pair. He is the sweetest guy, and I would honestly ask him a history question over a text book any day - he knows it better and explains in a way that makes sense and is relevant. His stories really make the class. You are missing out if you don't choose this sequence!
I honestly loved professor Cole. Now that I think about it, I am really going to miss going to his class. I really didn't like history before hand but his crazy stories and drawings really helped me remember the material. The bean quizzes can be difficult, but if you say there was a problem with blackboard you can basically get away with anything.
Love his bow ties he wore everyday and his humor.  His ""bean quizes"" are really annoying but if you read they are generally an easy 5 points.  His tests aren't bad, they are based off the OWLS he posts every week, so as long as you find the correct answers and memorize them you are golden.  This class seemed pretty difficult to me for being HST 102
The sweetest man ever! I had a hard time understanding the material, but it was a high level for my first Russian History. Extremely laid back and understanding. Love him!
I hate history and still do but he is so quirky and sweet that I didn't mind the class. Loves history and always laughs at random ironic facts, which makes everyone else laugh and lectures bearable. He has also led a VERY unusual life and has plenty of stories that no one should miss.  Rydel and Cole are an excellent choice for honors civ.
he's a really nice/funny guy, but be warned, if you don't like history don't take him. if you like history im sure it'll be great. i have not taken history since early high school and he jumped into it to quickly for me. and everyday is a boring lecture. if you dont like history you probably will have a hard time staying focused/interested.
Very knowledgeable, helpful, and interesting. Listen to his rambles, there's a good chance you'll remember what he's rambling about! The ""bean"" quizzes made me feel as though we were in 3rd grade but other than that I loved his class... and his bow tie :)",He is a very nice guy but is not a good teacher.

368,"There is a lot of reading to do. If you do the readings and participate, you will do well in this class. If you don't read, I can see why people would not like this professor since your grade is based on your journal responses and pop quizzes. I really enjoyed her take on things, but this class is very difficult. Only take if serious about writing.
This professor put zero grades in all semester and was very passive. Never answered emails. There is no makeups for anything and attendance is mandatory. She is not accommodating at all and she has clear favorites. Everything is handwritten and she does not use blackboard ever. I would not take this class or this professor again. 
Professor Blumreich is nice and knowledgeable. She can joke around, recognizing that British Lit can have views outside of today's norms. Lectures are important and attendance is mandatory, tests cannot be passed without class. Tests are hard and meticulous, and she grades specifically. Do not expect to know your grade until the end, only 3 grades.
Dr. Blumreich is interesting and intelligent, but also a tough grader. She has a modern worldview, but expects students to know scripture (many of the works we read had Christian themes and symbolism). Journal entries and essay have strict wordcounts, and participation is sometimes difficult/there's little time to speak up if you're shy.
Everything is handwritten, including journal entries with strict word counts. Late work not accepted. Material actually isn't too bad. A conservative Catholic worldview is assumed to be the norm. She encourages participation, but leaves very little time for it. She made a 3rd Reich joke on the first day. AVOID taking this class if at all possible.
This was one of my favorite classes! You read a new book every 1-2 weeks that focuses on a new aspect of death/dying and write a short reflection on each. Make sure you come to class ready to discuss and she is always open to new ideas/interpretations. You get to choose which book to do your big essay on. It may seem macabre, but you learn a lot!
This class was unnecessarily hard. By the sound of it at the beginning of the semester it sounds like an easy A class, but your grade only consists of 4 things making you have no room to mess up. To make it worse she grades unnecessarily hard!!! Would not take her ever again.
Dr. Blumreich was a very tough grader. I'm not particularly confident in my essay skills but I think she was very nit-picky when it came down to her grading. This class specifically didn't have any quizzes at all but I don't know if that was due to it being online or not. A good thing is Dr. Blumreich gave great feedback on everything we did.
The reading is interesting, but Professor Blumreich goes off topic a lot. She wants participation but leaves very little room for it. She talks a lot about Christianity and assumes everyone in class is Christian/was Christian at some point. I dont know anything about Jesus, can we talk about the reading? She seems nice, but class is frustrating.
This prof. made me feel humiliated with everything I wrote. Before this class I could pull a paper off and get an A no matter what, writing was my strength. While the prof. was happy to make time outside of class to help me, her expectations were rediculous. I'm a CRAZY hard worker and take school seriously, but my quiz grades were unacceptable....
This was by far the hardest class I have taken here at GV. She absolutely sucked as a professor. Her reading each night was way above our abilities with all our other school work. She didn't care that you were in other classes. She always had quizzes and expected too much out of you. I definitely would switch or drop her class if you have her.
for a 200 level course it is one of the hardest I have ever taken during my time at GV. Blumreich is extremely intelligent and she knows her angelo-saxon and medievel literature, but she constantly gives pop quizzes which I do not think fully demonstrates if we understood the text or not. Worried my grade is going to suffer in the class
Blumreich's class isn't a walk in the park but if you're willing to show up, take good notes and do the reading- you'll do just fine. She's very smart and a little intimidating but she loves her subject and that's part of what makes her lectures compelling.
Toughest professor I have had and GVSU. She doesn't care about helping students succeed in her class and definitely has favorites. If you don't read and don't look into your readings (as far as finding themes, symbols, etc) theres no way you're going to pass the class.
She is an inspiring professor whose feedback helped me improve my writing and literature analysis this semester.  She is willing to work with you outside of class on your papers.  She makes you earn your grades--no freebies here!
Absolutely does not care about her students actually learning or succeeding. The literature is great and definitely facilitates good discussion. If you take this class, take it with a different professor.
She goes off topic a lot. Yes she's smart and filled with information but I did not get what I needed from this course which was a deeper understanding of British literature. She's very hard at grading and not in a good way that makes you want to do better next time. She likes to bring up her own achievements a lot which leads her off topic.
Dr. Blumreich is an expert in Anglo-Saxon and Medieval literature. If you want to be challenged and expand your knowledge of English literature, take this course with her. Expect to read A LOT. You move from text to text fairly quickly. I recommend her especially to LGBTQ+ students, as she does not tolerate homo/trans/biphobia of any sort.
Professor Blumreich is one of the toughest English professors I have had at GVSU. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed taking her Literary Responses to Death and Dying class. We read a TON, but everything was interesting and made for a great in-class discussion every week. I would recommend her if you are looking for a challenging and helpful prof
In a word: awesome. She is crazy smart and basically overflows with info, I had her for Chaucer and she taught us more than the book ever could on its own. She's definitely into quizzing and she loves a good discussion so speak up in class and if you're confused SAY SOMETHING. She's more than willing to help out. Would definitely take her again.","Professor Blumreich is one of the toughest English professors I have had at GVSU.

TAKE!! Best teacher I have ever had! Intelligent, old fashion, energetic, NICE, caring woman. I will take again if I have to take an ENG course again! Love her
Professor Tyson is one of the best professors I have ever taken a class with!!!! She is extremely knowledgeable about the subject (she literally wrote the textbook), but the class is very interesting. Never boring, and I always looked forward to coming to this class. One of the best professors at GV!! TAKE HER IF YOU CAN!!!
The best professor I have ever taken at GVSU.  She really tries hard to make sure her students understand the material, and goes out of her way to help you.  Just make sure you show up to class and do the assigned readings and you will get an A for sure.
BEST PROFESSOR EVER & I HAVEN""T EVEN EXPERIENCED TOO MANY OTHERS YET!! EVERYONE should take her!! She's so interesting and engaging! I wish I could have her AGAIN!! Love her and her book is GREAT! AWESOME TEACHER :) TAKE HER TAKE HER TAKE HER!!
Prof Tyson is the best prof ive ever taken at GV. Her class is enjoyable and she makes it interesting. She accepts everyones opinions and will never tell a student that their ideas are wrong. The readings she assigns are great reads and the quizzes are over context and she gives alt quests! TAKE HER! GV is lucky to have her as a professor.
Tyson is the most helpful Prof I have come across at GV.  She wrote the textbook, but didn't make us buy it, just made copies of what we needed to read.  Read novels, take a few simple quizzes and two exams.  So easy, because she makes sure you know it.  Can't wait to take her again.
My favorite prof to date! She is hilarious, intelligent, and very helpful. I'm normally very shy speaking up in class, but she made everyone feel extremely comfortable and was not condescending towards students at all, which I've come across a lot with other professors. If you get the chance to take her, DO NOT PASS IT UP!
This was one of my favorite classes to date. Lois Tyson is brilliant and completely approachable. My class read 4 or 5 novels and watched two films. She had us focus on theory for this class. Psychoanalytic, Feminist, Marxist, etc. We wrote no papers. We had reading quizzes and historical context quizzes only. She's super nice and allows food!
I've never enjoyed a class so much! This lady is an amazing woman and if you get opportunity, I wouldn't suggest letting it go! She does not require any papers, only short quizzes that are very simple and of course a mid-term and a final. Great sense of humor, very caring to everyone. Sweetheart. Take her!
By far the best professor I have had at Grand Valley. ENG 495 with her is one of the most interesting classes I have taken. There were no papers required but she does give quizzes over the readings every day. This class requires higher thinking and hard work. You will learn a lot about the world and about yourself by the end of the semester.
Okay, besides Dr.Irhman, Dr.Tyson is my favorite professor I have had the pleasure to learn form at Grand Valley! She is super receptive to different viewpoints and is really good at listening to her students. I would love to take her again, perhaps my capstone! Quirky, funny, intelligent, thoughtful and so insightful! TAKE HER ASAP!!! =)
Lois Tyson is my favorite professor of my entire college experience. She is extremely intelligent and has a way of opening minds without offending anyone. She changed my entire way of thinking for the better. Take her!
Loved her. Quirky, but interesting and witty.
Sticks to good anthology. If you do the readings, you are set. Class includes one long paper and two tests. Very nice lady, only negative is strong political agenda is frequently dropped into discussion. Wish students had been held more accountable and challenged to do readings and participate in class.
Lois Tyson is my hero; her book is the****.
One of the best English prof's I've had.  She makes things really interesting and applicable to what you are going into.  Daily quizzes on the reading, but they are easy.  I loved taking this class with her.
If you have the opportunity to take a class with Lois, TAKE IT! She is the best English professor I have ever had. If you struggle with English she will hold your hand the whole way through. It is a SWS class and you only have to write ONE PAPER! She is a sweetheart and I wish I could have her for all my English foundations!
Lois Tyson is an awesome teacher. Her text is easy to use and easy to follow. She makes sure the class understands everything before she moves on and she is creative and funny (she even sings and plays the guitar for a review). Best English Prof. that I have had!",Prof Tyson is the best prof ive ever taken at GV. Her class is enjoyable and she makes it interesting.

370,"Cain is a lecture heavy professor and your grade is based on 4 exams. He assigned random homework assignments and never graded them, he just went over them in class and they were never on the exams. Go to lecture and take detailed notes. Go to review sessions and write everything he says. If you can get old exams this helps immensely.
Grade is based solely on 4 exams, but his C range is huge. Got low 80s and low 70s on first three exams, no clue about the fourth. His powerpoint slides are on canvas, but he pretty much just verbally lectures all the material. Really fast and is hard to keep up with, tells some funny stories though. GO TO REVIEW SESSIONS, he'll give away some Qs.
Its a tough class with almost no room for a better grade. cant recommend
Your grade in BISC306 with Dr. Cain is based entirely off of 4 exams. That's it. You're graded based off of your answers to 29 questions per exam. I bombed exam 2 and never really recovered. Semi-interesting material but he's hard to listen to sometimes. Go to class and the review sessions and don't let it all get away from you and you'll be fine.
He is a great guy, and always makes jokes or has anecdotes that are relevant. The exams are a little tough, but they are directly from the powerpoint slides. He does not grade three questions of your choosing and does curve. Best professor for 306.
Dr. Cain is a sweet guy but his class is pretty tough. His lecture slides have very little notes and goes through the powerpoints very fast. You're whole grade is based on ONLY four exams so there is little wiggle space to raise your grade. Recommend reading the textbook for more clarification and know almost all of the figures presented in slides.
Exams problems are directly from lectures. 30 multiple choices, omit 3 of them, and 5 extra points. Make sure you understand the lecture materials and you can do well. Since class time is very limited but there are so many things to cover, everything he talked in class is important. Read related textbook pages if you were confused about anything.
Class is challenging and although he's a nice guy, teaches as if you already are an expert in the subject. Moves quickly and not the best lecturer, but study hard and you can do well. Textbook not needed
This class with professor Cain was very enjoyable. I learned a lot and had fun too.  Two lengthy papers are the only requirements, but he guides you through each. He is always there to help and give advice. Attendance is recommended since you cover a lot in each 3 hour class period. Definitely recommend for investigative lab requirement.
I took physiology with Cain, and although he's super boring, his exams are pretty fair. 30-35 multiple choice, can omit 3-4, and 5 extra credit questions. The textbook is good to have for looking up more info on the diagrams, but usually just memorize the power points and you should do fine. He holds review sessions and will answer any questions.
Dr. Cain is a great person who really wants his students to succeed. He is very willing to meet outside of class and help students. His lectures are good, but for the best grades you should follow along with his power points. His exams can be difficult, but if you study hard, you'll ace them. I'd definitely take a class with him again.
Professor Cain is a very nice guy... His lectures are just so boring, it was hard to attend (since participation doesn't matter). Exams are tough, C- average I'd say but he's a curver! Not as terrible as I was expecting... and I'm one of those people who don't study until 2 days before the exam.
The lectures aren't available online, and there is no course capture, so even though attendance is not mandatory it would be best to go. He goes through the lectures kind of quickly and he is sort of jumps around sometimes. He holds reviews before the exams - GO. The exams are tough, so be sure to know your stuff. Overall, not too bad.
Powerpoints do little to guide studying and don't follow the sequence of information in the book. Doesn't respond to emails or hold office hours. The syllabus says nothing about grading or how to contact him,  just lists lecture topics. Doesn't post grades. Tests are only about 35 questions so missing a couple equates to many points lost.
Cain is a great teacher, despite what most people think. If you listen in class and study the slides till you know everything, you will do well on the exams. He moves a bit fast in lecture, but this is only because there is so much material to cover. Would recommend taking him over Laverty.
This has easily been the hardest class I've taken at UD, and it shouldn't have been. I found the course to be extremely difficult just because professor Cain makes it difficult. His office hours never helped, he jumps all over the place, and his tests are extremely hard. Reading the book didn't even help me that much. Would not recommend him.
Dr. Cain was definitely one of the best professors I have had. Going in with a moderate interest in the subject, I found this class to be very engaging. Two big papers (he makes it clear what and will work with you) and no exams. I wouldn't say it was easy, but it was very manageable. Highly recommended for the investigative lab requirement. 
Hard class. Hard topic. Doesn't help that this guy is soo bad at lectures. His powerpoints are extremely disorganized and full of annoying typos and errors. Total shame because he seems like a nice guy. I'm pretty sure the class had a 40something average on one of the exams. They're multiple choice but there is a lot of jargon. Study the text.
He's a nice guy but his teaching skills stink. This course shouldn't have been this difficult, he would test on things he didn't even go over in detail at all. Type everything he says because he will find a way to test you on it even if it seems random. Memorize his slides, know them verbatim! a 62 is a C in his class thats how bad it is.
so confusing it hurts. he literally would be talking about something and change topics mid sentence.. office hours - not helpful either. honestly to do well go to class and try to TYPE everything he says, memorize power points for sure, and use textbook to review pictures/ anything else you're not clear of. Such a hard class though..","Class is challenging and although he's a nice guy, teaches as if you already are an expert in the subject. Moves quickly and not the best lecturer, but study hard and you can do well. Textbook not needed"
371,"I would not recommend this instructor due to unproductive lectures, misaligned assessments, challenging exams, outdated teaching methods, poor time management, and rushed important concepts, which hinder the learning experience.
Average professor for lab. Nice guy and would answer questions when needed. However, his pre-lab lectures were extremely boring, long, and unnecessary and he would take points off my lab report when my partner and I literally answered the questions with him... Also lost points for labeling units in my chart header and in the chart...
He clearly knows a lot about the subject but when it comes to teaching it he's lacking. His lecture videos are long and monotone so it's difficult to stay focused and not get bored. He's very rude when it comes to addressing questions, he gets frustrated quickly when you don't understand something and says it's easy when it really isn't.
Carlson is an old fashioned teacher who is very knowledgable. During discussion he is a great help and wants you to succeed. The lectures are important to attend in order to understand what will be on each exam. He gives great study guides and opportunities for extra credit. You only need a 90 to receive an A in the class, just work hard and study.
I don't know what other people are talking about, I've had classes that were way harder than this. He bounces around a little bit in lectures, but I thought it was fun and he always covered the material. I barely studied, just do the hw online and pay attention in lecture and you'll do great. His transition to online was the best of all my prof's!
I found that the only way I would get between an 85-90% was if I studied about 3 weeks in advance to a test. Once we moved online, I understood the material much better because he was able to slow down with his lectures, but in the classroom, he would go too fast. However, he was helpful during office hours and discussions.
He moves very fast through complex material that my brain needs a second to comprehend. He also goes off on tangents, which makes you get lost in all the information he's throwing at you. His exams are VERY challenging, all fill in the blank & open ended, no mc. The first few weeks he makes the class seem easy and fun then after that its a b*tch.
if you want to get a good grade in CHM 230 do NOT take this professor. His lectures are done entirely on the white board and he goes back and forth in his explanations of things, making it super hard to understand. He is also the only chem professor who gives fill in the blank EXAMS. had to retake
worst professor I have ever had. He teaches on a whiteboard and goes back and forth. His exams are all fill in blank. There's weekly homework but that is extremely hard too and gives you no feedback on what you did wrong. He is so knowledgable but doesn't know how to make things easy to understand. DO NOT TAKE. I had to retake the class
Hes pretty nerdy but he does an excellent job at explaining everything. I feel like Todd gets a bad wrap because if you ask him a question about something hell tell you 10 other things you didnt ask about, which is typical coming from a chemistry teacher. He also goes on the board to teach instead of prepared slides which just makes him better.
This was the hardest class Ive taken so far by far. Carlson was very lecture heavy, but thats expected. His tests were NOT multiple choice. He wrote them himself and were SO HARD! Weekly homework is sometimes hard but you get 5 attempts. Quizzes during lecture are group quizzes. Hes a hard grader. Not very nice either. Doable but very hard work.
I would not recommend him at any cost. Do WHATEVER you can to get out of his class. The exams were extremely detail oriented and the lectures were hard to follow. He's a nice guy but he is ineffectual when teaching. You have to take your own notes completely and the tests are all written. Crams material quickly and never revisits it.
Try not to take him at all costs. I turned down a different prof just to get out of a night class& had carlson instead & it ended up being the worst mistake thus far into college. Do not take him. Nice guy but too smart to teach adequately. I love chem & would like to think im decent at it & Im struggling a lot in his class. I will have to retake
No powerpoints in class, contradictory teachings, tests dont match study guides, never explains things clearly.
Prof. Carlson does not use any powerpoints or technology during lecture so it's difficult to keep up with his writing on the board. Every exam is short answer (no MC) & they are pretty difficult. He has issues connecting with his students and going to office hours isn't very helpful. I wouldn't recommend him.
His lectures are not very organized and clear which makes learning from him quite difficult. His tests are not terrible, but very much free response heavy. I recommend getting a tutor and seeing him outside of class.
He's a tough grader and definitely makes you work for a good grade. He loves to answer questions and help you though. He gives bonus points for doing better on each exam. Write down everything and KNOW it, don't memorize it, and you will do just fine. I worked hard and did great.
He was way to smart to be teaching this class. Lectures are hard to follow, grading is scattered. He is really helpful one on one, but it isn't enough. No extra credit or curving, and really test heavy. Personally did not like him as a professor
Prof Carlson is very smart and knows his chemistry!This class has been easier than I anticipated, although it's still a challenge. I go to tutoring once a week, read the book, and study my notes, and I have been doing just fine. He gives lots of review questions before every exam, so do them! It's a difficult subject regardless. He's a great prof.
Professor Carlson is very smart, but he jumps around in lectures which makes it very hard to understand what he is talking about. He does not use prepared notes, so you are expected to take notes based on what you understand about the topics. I would not recommend him if you struggle with science classes.","Professor Carlson is very smart, but he jumps around in lectures which makes it very hard to understand what he is talking about.

375,"She's the ENGL department's internship coordinator. Dislikes non professional writing concentrators. Doesn't tell you the internship requirements at all, you need to view her website to find out on your own. If you don't know where you want to intern, she won't help you at all. Hates indecisiveness and confusion.
OH GOD THE EYES. DO NOT STARE DIRECTLY INTO HER EYES, NO MATTER HOW MUCH SHE STARES AT YOU. Also, she definitely favors some students over others. Get on her good side early, and stay on it. Agree with the stupid things she says. That said, the books are awesome the ePortfolio will be useful to you. So get out of the class what you can!
an interesting class, several projects but very short and easy to do; helped perfect my resume and cover letter which was definitely helpful, not a very hard grader; i am taking her again in the spring
She is not the easiest grader and does appear to favor some students over another.  However, you can revise your papers and they aren't long papers, so its easy to revise till you get an A.  If you don't mind revising, then getting a good grade isn't that hard.  Otherwise, find a more flexible, fair-minded teacher for a better grade.
Shes a very helpful teacher.  Knows what she is talking about.  The projects at times can be a little bit boring but overall this was a good class.  I recommend taking her if you can.
While it may be hard for some people to accept, Worley doesn't favor EBT students- she favors students who can actually write. The class is an easy A- take the time to read over your work before you submit.  Lectures are optional if you have common sense- your grade does depend on going to class. I slept/daydreamed through the lectures and got an A
The best professor I had at UD- she helped me get an internship and was a mentor during my college experience.
Very Nice teacher. Lectures are booring, and she randomly takes attendance. Not the easiest grader, but not alot of work. Papers are easy just need to be edited well.
Do not take this class unless it is an absolute requirement.  Not only are the classes pointless but she is the most disorganized person I have ever met.  Never gives back revised papers and really does not care.  Seems to lecture on common sense things and favors EBT majors who are brown nosers.
Very nice lady and good teacher, not a hard grader and lets you revise everythin
Narrowminded, doesnt give back revised papers, boring..stop smoking, u smell
doesn't give revised papers back; a very boring class--take only if u need it!
Easy because she teaches writing to be technically perfect. Excellent.
One of the most boring experiences I've ever had. Narrow minded.
She is very good at teaching technical writing  and her classes are interesting.","She is not the easiest grader and does appear to favor some students over another.

379,"Madame Kugler is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. She makes an effort to remember everyone's name and greet everyone at the beginning of class, and she really cares about each student's success. I will warn you that you have to be present and participate to pass, but it is not a hard class, even if you're bad at languages like I am.
I do NOT recommend this professor to ANYONE. Homework is given every night but never checked or gone over, so it's hard to know if you've got it right. There is very little in-class instruction. Students are expected to teach themselves the material from the textbook outside of class. Very difficult to follow & class structure is often disorganized
Madame Kugler is an extremely nice professor who really cares about her students' success in the course. As long as you pay attention and study for the quizzes and exams, you should be good. One of the best teachers I've had at UD.
Madame Kugler is a great teacher! She is a lot of fun and is very creative with her in class exercises. Homework is easy, and she is very helpful if you have trouble!
Sweet, energetic, helpful and fun, I definitely recommend her!
Madame Kugler is such a nice lady and she tries really hard to get her students good grades. I am not very good in languages in general so I took the class pass/fail but I think I would've gotten a b- or a c+ anyway. If you think you are good at languages though you will certainly get an easy A.
I love Madame Kugler! She's very energetic and cares about her students. Makes class fun. Better than Coulet du Gard
There is no better French teacher at UD. Extremely pleasant, energetic teacher--very creative exercises in class.
a very nice lady, but her class was hard. she's a tough grader and isn't always at her office hours when she says she'll be (which is great when you try to go before the final......). doesn't do a lot of speaking exercises. I heard Celli is better
Can be so unorganized, random, confusing & a difficult grader, but the truth is, Kugler is an AWESOME person who cares about her students & teaching French.  She is so knowledgable & will find the answers to the things she doesn't know!  Take her!
very nice, energetic, helpful. group projects are fun. tries her best to keep you awake at 8 in the morning. tests not hard if you know the vocab. generally good class.
She is very energetic, fun and sweet. She makes the class interactive and has you do group projects. She's a great teacher and is willing to help you. Go to office hours if your confused. Try and take her class.
I thought the class was pretty hard.  If you miss it it really affects you.  If she likes you, you will get a better grade. PARTICIPATE in class--it makes a difference. She is very sweet and SO energetic...I think she drinks 10 cups of coffee before class
cutest teacher ever!  really puts in the extra effort to make sure you know your stuff.  very personable.  an incredible teacher -- don't pass her up :)
great teacher, fun class, sometimes difficult material, but she'll help you until you understand it.
i thought she was hard. a lot of group projects and hw.sweet but hard.
Very nice teacher, good class, you can't skip that many classes,it affects grade
VEry cheery, nice, clear, fair, and helpful. great prof.
Very nice, excited.Not always clear.Req's way too many student group projects.","Madame Kugler is one of the nicest professors I have ever had.

381,"She is very sweet and knows and cares a lot about what she teaches. She is a tough grader, but it is only ever writing assignments. Class can be slow at times but the in class assignments are super easy. If she knows you and you appeal to her interests then she will really like you. Class can also have good discussions.
15 pts/week for participation, but can say the most basic thing & get pts writing assignments every 2 weeks, but not more than 600 words lects. sometimes boring & sometimes interesting prof EXTREMELY vague on instructions for every single assignment (including midterms & finals) have to ask tons of questions to get a feel for it & still confused
Professor De Cunzo is very passionate about what she teaches and is very accessible outside of class. However, the coursework is a lot, with readings every week, in addition to the essays and projects every other week. For an elective, it is not an easy A whatsoever. Assignments are usually confusing and you have to put in a lot of work to pass.
Class had 4 projects and 2 essay exams. The essays were time consuming but not bad. The projects were terribly explained, harshly graded, confusing, and barely based on material learned during the lectures. We had to teach ourselves how to do them and then received bad grades when this self-teaching didn't work out. Overall, a disaster of a class.
Literally the worst professor Ive had in my life. Extremely vague grading system where even if you do everything asked you STILL get bad grades for not doing it precisely as she wanted, barely any assignments so that if you do bad on a single one it brings your grade down a lot, and completely inflexible. No extensions allowed. Avoid at all costs.
Run away! This class is awful, and I've had to hate my way through it for my major. Lectures are vague; tests mostly pertain to the readings provided. You will have a project with multiple parts, will not explain what anything means (so just google ""stratigraphy""), and she will take points off without being specific as to what you've done wrong.
I am 11 credits away from graduating. I am a ""mature"" student and am not afraid of putting in the work. After 2/3 of a semester I still had no idea what she wanted, how she graded and worst of all I learned more about archaeology in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" I dropped the class over frustration. She has been the WORST professor I have ever taken.
Professor De Cunzo is a very nice lady who obviously cares about the subjects she teaches. However, she struggled to present the overall messages she was looking for in our papers throughout her lectures, and her unclear grading criteria made getting anything above an 85 a very tough task. Nice lady, hard class!
Took this class to fill credits. Makes the class all about politics, when that isn't the basis of the entire course. Super strict grader, would not take another class with again,
Tests are extremely writing intensive. Your hand will fall off. Harsh grader throughout the whole semester but somehow I still ended up with an A-.... Participation is not just attendance you actually have to raise your hand and talk or expect a poor grade.
The class is very interesting, but it is challenging (It is college after all). She is Very nice and happy to answer questions. You get to do quite a bit of alternative learning (guest speakers, fieldtrips, cooking project). Tests are writing intensive. Overall a wonderful class. Im an ANTHRO major but have never had her before.
Expect to not get higher than a B. She has too many high expectations and will grade you off of her own vague rubric. I went to her several times and she did not give me any advice on how to succeed and make changes. No matter what, this class will make you anxious and make you feel insane.
Her lectures are literally slide shows of pictures with no context, she expects you to read lengthy articles that have not assign and then has tests on them.
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. she has her own agenda and makes up words and concepts as she goes.
I really did not like this class. It fulfilled a breadth requirement but was worse than all my other classes.
I have taken college level Anthropology courses before and loved them, but this class was horrible. Dr. De Cunzo is very vague in what she wants from your assignments. She will not discuss the reasoning behind your grades. And she is also the department chair so you can't really do anything about it. I highly recommend you do not take this class.
DO. NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. PLEASE. for your SANITY. This class is so much more work than it's supposed to be. It's so totally unnecessary and I have been driven up a wall with the amount of work I have to do. She's always vague about what she wants, and it's impossible to predict if you've achieved what she wants or not! Just don't take this class
Terrible class. Terrible teacher. I've never felt so behind or confused in a class. Projects and papers are nearly impossible- everything assigned is so vague. Do not take this class, please.
Dreadful class. Reading the books for this class is a must! I didn't and it screwed me over because trying to study for the tests is impossible without them. She stalls half the time in class and is terrible at telling you what the assignments are about . Avoid her at all costs!
Honestly this class is pretty easy, if you know what she's asking you for. Her assignments are confusing, and she isn't always clear on what she wants, but if you show up to class and do half of the readings you're golden. Looking forward to taking her again.","Literally the worst professor Ive had in my life.

387,"I had Christine for all of her classes-she is a wonderful professor and very helpful.  Hope all is well for her! :)
Professor Rydel is Grand Valley State University's most valuable asset. Take a class with her before she retires and you won't regret it.
Like most say, Rydel really cares about her students. She is an excellent editor and will improve your writing drastically.
I dropped Russian after this, but it was because I don't currently have use for the language, not the teacher. She was one of the best I had. She was quite helpful and knew the language very well and very devoted to her students. Also let you retake stuff you did bad on. Her goal was to help you learn the language, not just give you the grade.
One of the best professors I've had in my college career. Really cares about the students, and their success. Tells fun and interesting stories about her experiences in Russia. I feel like I learned a lot this semester and didn't need to kill myself doing it.
She really tries to help everyone out. As she says Rule #1, Trust Rydel.
TOTALLY FRUSTRATING SEMESTER. A lot of our class time got spent on departmental drama and issues that have NOTHING to do with Russian grammar. No standards; all tests and quizzes were take-home, homework finally got returned week before finals. Despite my best efforts, my Russian got worse.  I'll pass on 202, thanks.
In my 3+ years at GV, she is the absolute best professor I have ever had. She is a true academic and knows Russian language and culture like no other. Does everything to help you and is extremely understanding. Tells great stories.
My absolute favorite professor. I was ready to drop out of college until I entered the Russian Studies program. She is willing to go the extra mile for her students, and tries to help everybody achieve a good grade in the class. On top of that she is a great storyteller, and a fascinating individual. Make sure you get her classes before she retires
Does not return work, but talks endlessly about how it will be returned. Has 4th year students grade your things.  Vindictive, takes class time to decry ""persecution"" by administration.  Attendance not mandatory, cheating encouraged.  Also has students patrol this site and have negative comments removed.  Russian is cool, but not worth the hassle.
Can?t imagine freshman year without her writing help. Gets very behind due to health issues but makes time to help any student that asks. Deadlines are flexible. Lectures can be boring, but she?s led a crazy life and has a lot of great stories. Put some effort in- she?ll give you an A and your writing will improve dramatically.
Rydel is brilliant. She tends to bring personal situations to the classroom and there is a tendency to get behind but this type of frazzledness is dismissible because she's so smart!
Cannot stand her. She uses the class like a personal soap box and has superiority complex over other professors, though she rarely covers the text she assigns when she assigns it. She's lenient about deadlines, but more out of necessity than kindness. Misses class. Brings personal affairs to the classroom. Has personal vendettas against students.
Extremly helpful, very quirky and funny, explains material extremly well
awesome
Professor Rydel is a true scholar and professor. GVSU would not be the same without her.
Great if she likes you. terrible is she does not. Personna non grata is accurate and very petty.
Prof. Rydel is crazy (but in a good way).  She would do anything for her students and definitely keeps class interesting.  She is insanely smart and isn't strict on deadlines.  Make sure you participate in class and you will like your grade.
Rydel and Cole are a great choice for the Civ sequence. She's very understanding and helpful with the papers... just be ready to READ!
Wonderful professor. Very helpful!!","One of the best professors I've had in my college career. Really cares about the students, and their success. Tells fun and interesting stories about her experiences in Russia. I feel like I learned a lot this semester and didn't need to kill myself doing it."
388,"Dr . Pemberton was a great professor. The class was not very difficult. It consisted more of papers and projects rather than tests. She made class interesting and also included a lot of group work into class meetings. Overall, I totally recommend Dr. P.
This class wasn't the worst, the quizzes were hard but the in class assignments were easy. You work with your group on everything which can be annoying. Some assignments were often confusing. Field placement is fun & eye opening. Projects are easy too as long as you follow rubric. I would take her again, she cares about her students.
Dr. Pemberton is my favorite professor at UD. Dr. P genuinely cares about all of her students, and will always find time to meet with you. In regards to the class, it's important to read the textbook so that you can do well on the online quizzes, and also for the one test that you have toward the end of the semester.
I really liked her, she was so sweet and will definitely help you if you need it. she's understanding and soft spoken and absolutely my favorite professor I've ever had. only one exam in class and its sooo easy I got a 93 on it and I didn't even know we had it that day(in other words I didn't study at all), its sort of like a high school class:easy
Not a hard class at all. Honestly just like a high school class. She lectures off of powerpoints, and we have 2 projects that we do in groups. Attendance is not mandatory and she posts the powerpoints online. My negative--she doesn't know a single students name.
Pemberton was one of my favorite professors at UD. She is so helpful and sweet and always willing to lend a helping hand. She's really patient and her class was pretty easy. Basically if she likes you you'll get a good grade!
A very nice professor! Classes were most often discussion based with a lot of group work. There were 5 online quizzes, one in-class exam, two group research projects, and a mentoring report. There was almost always reading from the textbooks, which was the only tedious part of the class. Professor Pemberton was a great teacher for the class.
Yeah, she's a really easy grader and you learn a lot. You've got to be a dingbat to get anything below an A in her class. No tests, just... ""formative assessments"". You learn a lot and the subject itself is not very challenging at all. Expect a lot of group work.
Take this professor if you can! She is very nice and cares about the students. Just be prepared for assignment guidelines that can be lengthy and she really likes for you to use the book/PPT Slides as references for papers which can be a lot at time. You must do reflections for field placement, too. The Microteaching at the end is fun!
Pemberton is awesome! She is such a nice woman and her class is really easy and interesting. You have 1 paper, 1 test and no mid-term or final exam. Great professor! Def. take this course with her, no doubt about it!
She is a very sweet woman. There is a lot of reading,but they are interesting topics. The field placements are great & there is a 6 page mentoring report for it as well as 2 group projects in discussion. Overall, this was a great class.
She is a very good teacher. Make sure you do not miss a quiz, it is an automatic zero. Missing class for scheduling next sememster's classes is unexcused. She accepts everything late, except for quizzes. Textbook readings are unnecessary, but the articles are. There are 3 tests, 2 papers, 1 group project, other small things, and no final.
Had both her and Lavigne and she is def better.  However, the class and tests were not as easy as everyone is saying.  Lectures are boring and a lot of the exams are from the book and she does not review it in class.  Take her if you can, but expect a lot of reading...not my favorite.
Easy class, shes really helpful and the material is interesting
Very nice lady but lectures are really boring.  Always willing to help though.  Exams are kind of tricky but study and you will do fine.
Tests very straight forward. Easy A. Interesting/helpful class for el ed.
Tests are common sense.  She is really nice and knows a lot. Hard grader!!!  Recommended.
She is one of the best professors i've had so far!  I actually pay attention in lecture and she uses real life examples, clear notes, and a clear syllabus to explain everything.  I'm taking a course she teaches again next semester!
She is a good person and a good teacher.  For a lecture it is not terribly boring.  Always willing to help and you can always talk to her after lecture.  I recommend her for EDUC202.  Don't really have to read either, and the exams aren't bad.
Great Professor. Very flexible and approachable. GIves good examples and presents things in a n interesting way. You don't really need to do the readings.",Pemberton was one of my favorite professors at UD. She is so helpful and sweet and always willing to lend a helping hand. She's really patient and her class was pretty easy. Basically if she likes you you'll get a good grade!
389,"The professor himself is a very nice person and I can tell he cares about his students but his teaching style is seriously odd. He talked about the cases the whole time which quickly got boring and there were only 3 exams and a small oral assignment that we were graded on. The exams were extremely difficult because it's so hard to keep up with him.
Really cool professor but difficult class. I would not recommend this class as a breadth-- tests are hard. The mean for tests was never higher than 80. Many questions are poorly worded and designed to trick you. For this class, you're graded by 3 tests and 1 easy speaking assignment in class. I'd recommend taking an easier course with this prof.
Each week you have 5-10 court cases to review. Then he goes over all of them in class. Lectures are typically two hours so the classes can be long and boring, but it's worth going so that you know what he expects you to know for each case. Most of it was interesting. The tests were all multiple choice, online, open-note so just take your time. 
TAKE THIS CLASS!! This was the easiest class I a have taken and enjoyed. If you are interested in the topic then this a a very easy class, if you are not interested this is also an easy class. 4 Exams, all online, all multiple choice. Class is easy with or without attending the lectures. 
This class is graded by three tests, which were all online and you're allowed to use Google for answers. Attendance is non-mandatory, but people who show up each week tend to do better. For the tests, just think and consult Oyez and they are honestly not hard at all and usually curved.
Graded only by three exams and one small speaking assignment. I mostly stopped attending class after the first exam and ended up getting 95+ on the two after it. Just take notes from Oyez and check the study guide. He kinda just rambles but it can be interesting at times. Exams open note and you get a week to do them. Extremely chill professor.
He's a cool dude. Does not take attendance, 3 tests that are actually hard but if you review materials and reviews cases you'll do fine. 
Prof Blacker's educ240 class wasn't ""easy"" but it wasn't hard. You definitely don't need to go to class just look at the syllabus and read the cases and take thorough notes on them. tests were on canvas an open note. it was graded on the 3 exams and then you were assigned a case and just had to give a synopsis on it which was 10 free points
The course wasn't difficult, but you definitely have to watch the lectures or at least read about the court case in order to pass the class. He always added extra points to the tests and gave extra credit!
We only had 3 exams and one ten-point assignment. The exams were easy if you took notes on his pre-recorded lectures. He lets you use notes and Google. I've never been to a single one of his lectures on Zoom and still received an ""A."" In his lectures, pay attention to some of the details you wouldn't expect to be on a test. Overall, easy class.
I really like Professor Blacker, but the material is very difficult and the tests are worded strangely. This is easily the most difficult class I have taken. You aren't required to attend lectures, but it's advised because even when you do attend lectures you're not guaranteed to do well on the exams. 3 exams are also the only grades in this class.
I never watched his lectures I just read the cases and took notes on them. Even if you're notes are great it's still hard to get A's on the exam. The exams were online and open note but the way questions were worded made them tricky. I needed 0.5 more points for my grade to go from a B+ to an A- and he wouldn't give it to me.
I really enjoyed this course. Lectures were asynchronous and then met at class time to go over material again and for questions. 3 exams and then one small assignment that added 10 points to a test grade (helped me and helps if you do well on exams). Make sure you take notes and you should be fine. Paced in a way where it is up to you.
LOTS of readings on court cases for people who dont study law or arent used to reading a lot. A better way to study the material is to just look up youtube videos on the court cases. One small, super casual, presentation worth like 10pts. Three exams with about 40 multiple choice questions. Professor is chill but the class was not for me.
Prof Blacker is honestly one of the best profs I've ever had. He genuinely shows that he cares for his students and his class is pretty low-stress. You don't really need to show up, but if you don't be prepared to memorize a lot of cases. 3 exams (50 multiple choice questions) and a small 1-minute presentation
Prof. Blacker is super laid back in class and he doesn't really take attendance. Going definitely helps because he'll mention specific terms that are on the tests and taking/adding to your own notes in class is helpful. Other than the 3 exams, there's a short sitting ""presentation"" but that's the extent of the participation and grading.
Professor Blacker was nice and funny but I can't say much about him because I really did not enjoy EDUC240. The exams were very hard for me because I do not have a perfect memory and you must memorize the details, verdict, and noticeable dissents of numerous court cases for each exam. If you take the class, GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS.
No attendance policy, ends class early but still a two hour late lecture with no visual aid. No need to go to the class unless your presenting. Grade consists of three exams and one homework assignment which is ten points added to your third exam that brings up your grade. As a breadth not the worst for cramming day of exam just memorize cases.
didn't enjoy the idea of only 3 exams being the only grades for the semester. topics are difficult to comprehend. exams are confusing. lots of reading. nice guy and enjoyable to listen to stories he has in class. wish there were power points to go along with material.
Was a fine professor. Talked for 2 hours straight in class. No powerpoints. All information you could look up by yourself. Requires a 2-minute presentation on a case for an easy assignment. Wish there were more assignments in this class and more grades.","Prof. Blacker is super laid back in class and he doesn't really take attendance.

391,"I love going to this class. Professor Poole makes learning Shakespeare actually pretty fun. As far as attendance, as long as you email her 24 hours within your absence, you will be excused. She is a pretty tough grader but as long as you are reviewing the feedback she gives you and taking her advice, you should be fine. 
Honestly she is a nice person and cares about her students a lot, but she should not be teaching a freshman English course. This was the first time in awhile shes taught an English course at this level. She expects her freshman students to preform like English grad students. Dont take her unless you have to for your English 110 course.
Professor Poole is absolutely amazing. Although she is a very difficult professor, she is always accessible to her students. If you are having trouble in class, go to office hours, as she is incredibly helpful and kind.
This woman is nice but not a good teacher. She doesn't care about your point of view unless she agrees with it. You will only get good grades if you write in the style that she wants. She thinks that she is very funny but in reality she is so bland and boring that most kids never say a word in her class. Only the ones who give her a chile.
Very ""my way or the highway"". If you're an English major or anyone who has already developed a writing style, she will not respect it and will most likely condescend you, telling you you don't know what you're doing. Basically, to pass, do exactly what she says, no more, no less. Take 0 risks. Kill your voice and creativity. Live the textbook.
I've currently taken two classes with doctor Poole and just signed up for a third. She's intelligent, charming, passionate, and easily one of the coolest English professors at this school. Her classes are mostly discussion based, but not like most classe; her discussions are organic, engaging, and probably the most rewarding I've had in my major.
She's so great....101 section is really easy as long as you go to lecture, which is usually more of a huge discussion most days. 110 was a little more challenging because it was an Honors section, but it was equally as awesome since we all got to know each in our small class. Overall just requires a decent effort on your part and you'll do well.
honestly the best prof I've had here. she really will help you become a significantly better writer. a whole class on King Lear sounded pretty terrible to me but you grow to love it or at least appreciate it...take classes with her she's lovely
Rare blessing was given to me when she open the class ""the Idea of Story in Theology"" at Lutheran Seminary. As a graduate theologian, I could have better theology than her. But she guided me to the way where I could find ""the story."" The story that she led me find is now great language with which explain my and Paul's love of God and his people.
Kristen was a great professor. This was her first time teaching 101 so there were a few kinks for us, but the class was fantastic. 4 exams and a few little quizzes. Take good notes, attend every lecture, and READ AND STUDY THE LITERARY TERMS and you'll be fine. Overall easy class.
If you come into the Shakespeare class expecting a literature class (heaven forbid), you'll be in for quite a surprise. Dr. Poole teaches Shakespeare like it's history and won't accept any interpretation of the text if it's not based on her own, often poor, interpretations.
Shakespeare - I thought it was really tough and that her exams were unfair, but if you can manage to make it to her office hours, she's super helpful, and her lectures were always very entertaining and fun
Poole is awesome. As a science major, I was uneasy at first taking a Shakespeare class- but it was amazing. She kept class interesting, was helpful, and valued input during class discussions. Also, exams were really fair. If you don't mind reading Shakespeare- TAKE HER!
Best professor ever. Hilarious class and she keeps it interesting, even though it's Shakespeare.
worst class ive ever taken. 2 huge assignments that took up more time than my 300 level classes. she is condescending and demands a lot. attendance is mandatory even though class is pointless. every day i wished that i dropped... do not take this class unless you want no life and want to live and breathe the most boring shakespeare plays
Do NOT take this class! (Shakespeare's history plays) is not worth it! she is a fairly nice woman but demands way more than a 102 class deserves. Giant portfolio assignment took so much time and effort, more than my english 400 level classes, and the end paper was ridiculous and harshly graded. Don't take if you are looking for an easy A or even B
whoever said her 102 class is easy is on crack. if you are a graduate student who wants to do nothing but read and write about shakespeare youll be in heaven... but if youre expecting a normal 100 level english class get out now. papers every week, a huge research paper and a ridiculous amount of reading. dont take her
Professor Poole seems a little dull at first, but once you get her humor and give her a chance she is really great. She is open to anyone's opinions or ideas about how the class is run. The workload is a little heavy, but it really pays off and you will learn a lot. Take her for sure!
I had her for brit lit I. She is good and very funny. Keeps class interesting with examples and such. She has interest in the subject. At first I didn't like that she made us do study guides but they were actually beneficial!Overall, I would recommend taking this professor if you had an opportunity to!
She is a great professor.  I almost like Shakespeare now!","Professor Poole is absolutely amazing. Although she is a very difficult professor, she is always accessible to her students. If you are having trouble in class, go to office hours, as she is incredibly helpful and kind."
393,"I love madam Celli i'm mad i wont have her as a french teacher. She's so thoughtful about each and everyone of her students. I learned more in her class than i did taking 4 years of french in highschool. I have trouble with french tenses but i understood them about more in her class. Madame celli je t'adore :)
This class was super easy for me but I think that it depends upon the type of student you are. I took French for 4 years in high school and I thought it was easy. There are assignments online and you can complete them far in advance. She doesn't give exams like other professors do, but she gave in class compositions which were easy to prepare for.
This lady is a QUEEN. I adore her so much. I hate french but I feel like I actually learned and enjoyed coming to this class. She was engaging and intelligent and her class was very well paced. All of the graded assignments and quizzes are fair and there are lots of opportunities to get your grade up. 
I absolutely adored her. She is so helpful and genuinely wants everyone to do well. She's also just one of the nicest people ever. I took this class because I had to and getting up at 7 every day was hard, but she made it worth it. Cannot recommend her enough, all the raves speak for themselves. She's a wonderful woman who will teach you a ton.
She is an ANGEL. So kind and caring. Definitely the most I've ever learned in french. There are weekly graded assignments and some online quizzes, but you will be prepared for all of it. 
She is a very good professor/person. Very nice and and genuinely cares about her students.
This class was amazing and so was Prof. Celli! This is a topic she is really passionate about so the class was very fun. Not difficult at all, just have to read a fun short story every few weeks and listen to her lectures.
took her for a month long class and she was amazing. by far the best french class ive ever taken. make sure u participate or your grade will suffer.
An amazing French professor, I went through FREN105 and 106, but if you are going straight from high school to this, it is still really good. She is the sweetest and is very knowledgeable about French. I legitimately enjoyed coming to her class every day, she is very fun and nice
She is really nice and funny but, you need to participate its really important.
Dr. Celli was a good instructor for FREN107 and cared about her students. She made the classes interesting and involved culture when discussing tenses or other conventions learned at the Intermediate level.
i absolutely loved Professor Celli. She's so sweet & really accessible outside of class. This was taken for a breath for me and I would easily take her again. Just do the readings she gives because you have reading quizzes about the plot and you'll be fine. 2 exams and final project. loved her and the class
I loved Dr. Celli! She cares so much about her students, her grading guidelines are clear, and she is very engaging during lecture. Take her class if you have the chance!
Professor Celli is one of the nicest teachers I have had at UD. She makes the class interesting and as fun as possible and you can tell she really wants people to do well. If you come to class, participate and do the work the class is very manageable.
One of the nicest professors I have ever had. Very understanding and kind. The class is homework heavy, but can also be used to boost your grade since it's pretty easy. She cares about her students and you can tell she truly wants them to succeed.
She is extremely interested in French and very sweet. The exams are hard but she is very approachable for help. Attendance and participation is very important. The first half of the semester you have online homework due every single night which is extremely annoying. Also paid $200 for a textbook that I didn't open once.
Prof. Celli was definitely my favorite professor I had this semester! She's available for help if you need it and she's very approachable. Attendance is important, but she's fun so she makes you want to come to class. She gives homework every night, but it's not a lot and definitely helps with the exams. Kindest professor I've encountered so far!
Prof. Celli is one of the nicest professors I have had. She truly wants us to learn French and that comes through in her classes. She really encourages participation, which seems scary at first, but she appreciates the effort even if you make mistakes.  If you do the homework exercises, the tests are easy. Definitely would recommend!
she is a nice person but it is hard to do well in the class if you're not already very good at french. the tests are very hard and it is A LOT of information to know. she also takes participation very seriously and won't give you a good grade if you don't answer questions every class. also-don't use your phone in class or you'll lose points
Madame Celli is the best french teacher that I have ever had. She is engaging, makes learning fun, challenges you, and is genuinely one of the nicest people. You can tell that she cares about her students a great deal. I recommend taking any class that you can with her!","Prof. Celli is one of the nicest professors I have had.

395,"This is the 2nd time I've taken one of Dee's classes. I've never learned so much from a professor at Rhodes. She's sensible, hilarious, & has so much knowledge. I know I'm getting the best education w/ her because of her incredible experience. Her tests are hard, but it's b/c she wants you to learn. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
Dee is the most incredible professor at Rhodes. If you have the chance to take her class, you will learn SO much. Her lectures feel more like a conversation - you can ask questions at any point, & she never fails to make you laugh! She is very accessible outside of class and gives great advice, not only for her classes but also for life. 
Her personality gets in the way sometimes and it makes thing confusing when trying to understand material. If you are a straight-foward student, try to avoid her at all cost. Also,make sure you pay close attention to all the readings in the book.
She is AMAZING! Dr. Birnbaum is brilliant and truly cares about the success of her students. I have never seen someone actually teach the way she does. I learned so much from the class. Tests are hard but you can get an A if you talk to her and take good notes.
Dee is one of the best professors I have ever had. You will learn a ton if you put forth the effort! Go see her and talk about the readings. She may be intimidating at first but she cares so much. Her tests are really challenging but she wants everyone to succeed
She is very smart, but super unclear in class, Lots of reading. Must go see in office hours to get an A
Dee is one of the best and most knowledgeable professors in the business department.  She has her quirks such as unashamedly cussing as well as barking at people but that's part of what makes her and her class so interesting.  Also, go talk to her in her office.  You will learn a lot from Dee about business management and life.
One of the most challenging and rewarding porfessors in the Business depatment. Dee expects hard work and dedication, but what you will learn is truely fascinating. She teaches you ins and outs of physiological side of business managment and gives you the tools to succeed in any workplace situation.
The class is hard as hell but it's a great class to take. You really have to understand the material and not just memorise it. She is really really helpful if you meet with her one on one. You can NOT miss class and have to be entirely focused while you are there. She is definitely the smartest prof at Rhodes and you learn a lot from her.
She didn't teach from the book, but gave us an easy time when because tests were mainly from it. So it wasn't really a problem that taking notes from her was confusing. Pay attention  though, she seemlessly switches from joking around about her own weird nature to basically saying which exact pages of the book she will ask you about on the exam.
THE DOG!!!! enough said.
Read the syllabus.  Read the syllabus again.  Do what it says.  You've now learned the secret to the course.  She basically teaches an intro research methods class, and just happens to apply it to management theory.  Go to her office with questions, and review your tests with her 1 on 1.
She'll grow on you as the semester progresses. She expects a lot from her students, but she's not unreasonable: she curves the tests like crazy, so don't freak.
She is an embarrassment to Rhodes College.  She may be an inteligent women, but doesn't not use that intelligence to further the education of the students.  The barking and growling are distracting.  I would never want alums or prostuds to see this clas.
yes, she likes to call herself weird. but she's so awesomely funny !
I took her for both management and HRM, and loved them.  I was a biz major and hated all the other classes, but liked and did well in hers.  You absolutely have to take good notes or you will be screwed, and do not even think about missing class.
Fantastically hard teacher, yet among the smartest ones at Rhodes.  I only recommend her for very good students, but it will be entirely worthwhile.
The only class where violence from the teacher means she likes you. I think the class is so difficult it isn't even helpful. She needs a KITA (but would that only be forward movement, or real motivation) I would be terrified if she was my belly dancing teacher
The ""dog"" is tough but really knows her stuff.
Run away.","Dee is the most incredible professor at Rhodes. If you have the chance to take her class, you will learn SO much.

399,"Dr. Krumpe is amazing. He is very respected and a super caring professor. He will put in the work with you based on how much work you put in. He is super flexible and will stay late on campus to help you learn. I recommend taking him if you're an athlete; he understands your schedule. He is a challenging professor, but be ready for lots of notes. 
As long as you want to learn he will work with you, he's got a big heart!
though test heavy, his exams are completely fair. Read the book and PRACTICE the problems, it'll save you. Dr. K is hilarious, caring, and will always work with you if you need help with anything. he tries to be as accessible as possible which is tough because he's so busy. Organic is tough enough, and he LISTENS to his students and slows the pace.
a great professor, and chem is difficult and confusing enough as it is so he doesn't try to trick you. Exams are difficult, but if you do the practice problems in the book you'll be fine. Group exams were very helpful, and he is very accommodating which is extremely nice of him. He always has review sessions so attend those. I definitely recommend
Dr. Krumpe makes organic chemistry somewhat fun. His lectures keep you on your toes and involved. He is great about giving clear grading criteria, thoroughly going over all material, and he teaches chemistry EXTREMELY well. You can tell he is very intelligent. The only downside to taking Krumpe's classes is that he is a dean so he is always busy.
Flies through the info. Talks about random stuff and makes weird comparisons. Definitely knows his stuff, super smart. If you enjoy chemistry and have a knack for it, then Krumpe will probably be a great teacher for you. I have a hard time with Chem and felt that he moved very quickly, you will spend a lot of time outside of class working.
I had taken Gen. Chem. 1&2 at a community college... So I was super afraid going into this class. This stuff mainly takes a lot of practice (time). Krumpe is awesome at using METAPHORS and making class a light hearted environment. Dont take a lot of other hrs during the semester, and you will do well in his class. He is def one of my favorites 
Krumpe is a wonderful professor and really knows his chemistry, he tries to dumb it down to an easier level and it usually works but it's a very hard subject to learn. He will work with you to his fullest extent; go to the SI sessions, go to class and take notes.  The tests are hard but it was what was covered in lecture.
Dr. Krumpe knows his chemistry. It is not an easy subject to learn, or to teach I imagine, but he is fair! He is always willing to work with the class on deadlines and is receptive to comments/questions. Make no mistake, his tests are HARD! But if you show up, do your work, and try hard, you'll be fine.
Dr. Krumpe is an amazing professor! This is a very tough class and he makes it completely manageable. Catalog your reactions early and it will come in handy during the semester. If you are having a problem, go talk to him.  Krumpe honestly cares about his students and is willing to come in on weekends to help with supplemental lectures. Take him
He is a very helpful guy! He is always willing to meet with students outside of class and help them understand. He takes notice of who is in class daily and pays attention. Do the problems in the back of the book and you'll do fine.
Nice guy, really tries to help. But he teaches so far above most student's level of understanding, his ""help"" is usually in the form of curving test scores. I did learn a lot from his class but it was mostly from outside help sessions and independent study.
Dr. Krumpe is an amazing professor! Organic Chemistry is a hard subject and it takes a great deal of effort to achieve an ""A"".  If you have an issue talk to him and he will help.  He will help you out as much as you help yourself out.
Claims that ""the material is hard enough, I'm not going to try and trick you with test questions,"" and then goes and does exactly that, will test on things never covered in class. Does not explain things, just barrels through the material and tells dumb stories.
uses metaphors to explain complex organic concepts, genuinely concerned about his students comprehension of the material
Hard but funny
best chemistry teacher i've ever had
Does not explain material well, or explains material that you don't need to know in that class. if you don't know your chemisty, do no take krumpe
He doesn't seem to know the difference between what we should know to understand the material and what is chemistry... he expects us to remember everything he says, even stuff from classes we didn't take with him...  Our faults are evidence of our stupidity, his faults are just funny to him... News flash: none of us have been to grad school!!!
Talks to each of his students as if we're Chem majors. Impossible to keep up with, curbs his tests, is much better in lab than in lecture. HORRIBLE in lecture.","Dr. Krumpe is amazing.

402,"I absolutely loved this class. He helped me identify ways in which my style was stagnating and could use improvement. He does have certain preferences on what a ""good"" style is, but I didn't get marked down at all for using anything else. I found him EXTREMELY helpful in improving my style, which is obviously good since I'm a writing major.
Obviously no one has had him for WRT 350... I think this was his first semester teaching it. If possible, avoid him for this class. Everything you do is so vague... he gives out assignments but never teaches you anything, and then he will mark you off for not doing things how he wanted. He brings oreos to class every day though.
Dwelle meant well and he was nice, but, like everyone else has said, he didn't make much clear and didn't really grade in any kind of realistic way. I got an A in his workshop, but he kept telling us things about modern writing that weren't true. I don't think he reads new books, you know?
Class is on writing styles but if he doesn't like yours, you're screwed.  Workshops were ok if you actually got in a group where they actually cared.  I'm a writing major. I had better luck asking my psych major friend to read mine...
He was a good prof. Stay on top of all the hw though, or ur in trouble. Papers were easy and fun. For a class on style of writing, I have to say he definitely impressed me. He was funny, and nice. Great writing prof, definitely.
Easy class with very helpful workshops. Do all the work and stay on top of the copy comments if you dont you'll be screwed at the end of the semester when you put together your portfolio.
Funny, good in-class workshops, and responds to emails quickly. Make sure you stay on top of the homework, you're screwed in the end if you don't. He's an awesome prof and i would definitely take him again.
Don't know how to grade him, because I have never known what my grade in the class is. I'm still waiting for my final grades to really rate him. class seemed easy...
As the other person has said, he grades you on his opinion of you as a person. And he speaks in a very monotonous boaring voice. The course is good, but he is not so good.
Do not take any class he teaches! He is the worst, most boring teacher in existence. His classes serve no purpose, you are graded on his opinion of you as a person.
Not very clear on what he is looking for - makes writing papers a bit confusing. Class can be boring at times, but overall, not too bad. It's easy.
The class is pretty boring but it's not the teachers fault. You pretty much decide your grade yourself. Although when he lecture it is boring.
this professor is very nice. he brings in donuts to class every day. he takes attendance, but is not too strict on the attendance policy (miss more than 4 classes you fail) but i wouldnt advise missing too many classes. although boring and pointless at times, you should still go.
this prof. is very good. he brings in food all of the time for our class and he is very helpful and easy going. the class is very easy if you pay attention and complete the assignments
There is no point in his class and he is very boring.  Feedback is not helpful.  AVOID THIS TEACHER.
i think he's a great guy. he was very helpful with ideas for stories and responded to emails quickly. i don't know where all the negative comments came from because i thought he was a good prof! he's funny and grades easy.
He is the worst teacher ever. He scares you into thinking you'll fail, and then he gives you a passing grade. He's a male chauvinist **** and makes inappropriate comments all the time. I don't know how he keeps his job. Avoid him.
I learned some valuable things to apply to my writing in this class, but I swear, I never fell asleep as much I did in this class.  Totally boring and I had to force myself to go sometimes.  I only turned in a partial portfolio and I got an A-.
Tried to scare us into thinking our papers were horrible, but I ended up getting a B.  Not very helpful prof but OK enough.  Just revise your papers and unless they really stink you'll be fine-it's not as easy to get a D as they make it seem.
I cannot put into words how much this guy does not deserve his job.  Just trust me...if at all possible, get a different teacher or withhold taking this class for the time.","Not very clear on what he is looking for - makes writing papers a bit confusing.

403,"Professor Cotter is awesome! Take him if you have the chance, especially if you are a marketing major. He has real life experience to share that relates to everything he teaches which makes lectures interesting and helps you retain information. There are only 3 tests that make up your grade, but he teaches right from the test.
Professor Cotter is amazing. He makes his lectures so interesting by using real life stories and job examples. I would take him again in a heartbeat. His class is based off of three tests, and he always says to trust the book before his lectures, so be prepared to read the book. Overall I really enjoyed his class.
Cotter is awesome! He has been teaching for years and what he does works! Lectures go into detail and interesting real world experience and stories Cotter has, that touch on topics from the book. Whole class is 3 exam grades, which means no homework! He has experienced so much, and might be one of the smartest people I have ever met.
Professor Cotter is my favorite professor by far at Grand Valley. This guy knows his stuff and his lectures leave you feeling as if you gained a few IQ points. For negotiations you CANNOT skip class as a majority of your grade is based off of being present. Great class, great professor. Highly recommended for all marketing majors.
Tests are easy if you come to class.  Real world stuff is worth the class alone.  Stories helped me remember stuff for tests.  He does seem to read minds without being scary.  I will take every class I can from him.  Best prof at GVSU.
I really enjoyed coming to Professor Cotter's class. A lot of the examples that he uses in class are based on his past experiences. Very funny guy but quite old school. 3 tests are the only grade for the class but they aren't hard at all. Just make sure you read the book and memorize the key terms in each chapter. Doesn't take much effot to do well
Gives great lectures that are fun to listen to. The class is based on 3 exam scores so that was kind of a bummer... I did not buy the textbook but it may have been helpful to have it.
Prof Cotter is a great teacher, but is very frustrating if you aren't a great test taker. There are only 3 tests, but there wasn't anything i was surprised to see on there. Just write down what he writes on the board and you'll be good. No homework.
Funny guy, pretty nice. He lectures and writes key words on the board. Get a buddy in the class because if you miss, that's the only way you'll get notes. Tests are from lectures and the book
Make sure to buy the book, as the tests are comprised mostly of the key terms from the chapters. His lectures are hilarious. He's a super cool dude, would definitely recommend him. The grade is based solely on the 3 exams, so make sure to attend class and study. Look over your notes and study the key terms, and you should do well :)
Lots of stories from his past experience. Let's the class out early a lot.
This guy has been through a lot. The material is really easy, so he lectures for a bit then adds his own hilarious anecdotal stories. You really don't have to show up to lecture to pass, but it is very entertaining. The whole grade is based on 3 tests, but they're really easy. Really enjoyed taking this class.
Cotter is a fun guy and makes lectures extremely interesting. Make sure to get the book though and read AHEAD of class. He is very quick with his notes so you have to read the book to fully understand what he is talking about. 3 exams makes up the entire grade for the semester so if you study hard for the tests you should do fine. One of the best!
This class is great. The material isn't super hard and neither are the exams. It's pretty easy to get an A- or B+ without much effort. Attendance isn't mandatory (unless indicated in syllabus) but you usually get out of class early and he tells awesome stories. Easily the best prof I've ever had at GVSU.
Get real practice in negotiating. Lots of stories on how to avoid getting taken in the real world.  Pretty easy tests if you come to class.
Funny, practical and challeging
He had great stories from his countless number of jobs he has had in the past.  He can be very funny but sometimes he gets on my nerves too.  Overall, it was a decent class.  His exams are  not too hard and he normally puts a curve on them.  For the SWS class you have to do two marketing plans.
Knows what you need for ""real world"" skills.  Funny stories but intense.  He can read your mind.
This prof has a lot of great stories to tell in class. The only thing that's hard is his exams. That's the only thing that's graded in the class. So if you're a poor test taker, pick someone else. Have to read the book, which is long. His exams are based solely on the book, no point in going to class except for the day before the exam review day.
It's a TOUGH class, but I learned SO much.  I'm signed up to take him for another class!","Professor Cotter is awesome! Take him if you have the chance, especially if you are a marketing major.

407,"Very encouraging and good at identifying how to help students become better speakers.
Awesome professor,  very funny and personable. Teaches information very thoroughly. 
Amazing teacher. Keeps even the most terrible information fun and interesting. Grading is straight forward and clear. Always willing to help you if you're struggling. Easy person to talk to and be around. Expects a lot, but it's never too much. All of her assignments can be done the day before easily, most are note packets.
This lady is great. She keeps you interested, makes class fun, tells funny stories, and makes sure you're prepared for tests, presentations, assignments, ect. Definitely have her as you communications professor.
Penny is an amazing teacher! She seems to really enjoy teaching which makes a big difference  especially in comparison to other profs that are just there for a paycheck. She is a fair grader and very helpful. I loved her class and plan on taking her other courses
Uses a variety of media and relevant materials, lets you know what to study for tests, fairly easy class.
Penny is a great teacher and definitely knows her material. However, sometimes her lectures seem to jump around which can make studying harder once the test comes around. You have to work hard in this class, but probably one of the most fun classes I've taken, along with being the most intellectually stimulating.
Penny is great!  She really knows how to make her students have a great time while learning.  She is very dedicated to her students and is an excellent advisor.  Join CN 101 for a great time!
Fantastic, makes class fun, very helpful
Penny is great. Her tests are fairly easy, but I still learned a lot in the class.
Enthusiastic
One of the most helpful teachers I've ever had, and she's very interesting during her lectures.  I just loved having Penny teach my Capstones!
One of the best teachers I have had...
Excellent at explaining things and relating it to life. . . very helpful if you don't understand anything
she was a great professor - i had her last semester and loved the class enough that i decided to stop being undecided major to a communication major
Penny is a top notch instructor and is able to successfully teach in a fun environment and still be able to get all the material across to the students. I may go back to Aquinas just to take her again. :)
I love Penny!
Fun!
Penny Avery is one of the brightest people I know. She is a wonderful example of a strong women.  I really enjoyed the ""Penny and Dave"" team and felt that I benefited immensely for taking those courses.
She is great most of the time.","Amazing teacher. Keeps even the most terrible information fun and interesting. Grading is straight forward and clear. Always willing to help you if you're struggling.

411,"Dr. Newton can be strict but if you pay attention to her lectures and study the material (focus on her PPTs) her exams are straightforward. She is very strict about the group paper/presentation. If you follow what she asks in the instructions, you should get a good grade. Visit her office hours, she's more than willing to help if you ask! 
Doc is tough in class but is very dedicated to the field. In office hours she is amazing and provides good feedback. If you pay attention you'll do just fine.
Was amazed how an ""intro to professional nursing"" professor was so unprofessional towards her students. There were multiple instances where she was very rude in class. The only thing that she grades that isn't group work were the midterm and final exam. Everything else in the class is group projects that she grades very harshly. 
DONT TAKE HER!! she was so rude!! The class was graded on a midterm, group presentation, group essay, and final. You need to do good on the exams in order to pass the class because she destroys your essay and presentation. Her exams weren't bad as long as you went to class and studied. Also if she gives the opportunity for extra credit DO IT.
Dr. Newton is very nice and is open to answering questions. She sets clear expectations, and the quizzes are based off of the content she discusses, so reading was not necessary but can be helpful. It is a hard class, but Dr. Newton seemed to be the best option. She gives very good feedback on the rough draft and provides examples. 
Definitely take this professor over the other option. Her quizzes are not too hard if you pay attention to her lectures and review them before the test. The final paper is 30% of final grade and each of the 3 quizzes is 20%. There is an easy reference page assignment that is 10% of the grade. She is very passionate about the class.
Definitely the prof you want for this class. Very passionate about research. Lectures can drag a little but she is caring & wants you to succeed. Go to class. She said we needed the textbook but I barely used it. Grade consists of 3 quizzes, an APA assignment and a final paper. Follow directions for final paper to a tee and you will be fine.
Despite Dr. Newton's reviews, this class was not too difficult. Quizzes were fairly easy. Claims to be a tough grader, but gave us the edits we needed for the final paper, and graded us very fairly. Lectures can be boring, but she is funny and cares about her students! Take her over Eisenhauer!!!
Dr. Newton was a terribly hard person to understand what she wanted from the group projects. The exams were a hit or miss on the information she was wanting you to study. You have to know the littlest details of things on the lectures. The group projects are very harsh and majority of your grade. For exams, good luck. 
It is no secret that Dr. Newton is knowledgable in research, however her expectations are through the roof. I followed the instructions for the essay perfectly and still managed to get multiple points taken off for the silliest reasons. I don't recommend taking her if you have the choice.
Don't expect her to stick around after class if you have questions. Sends rude emails and answers questions in a sarcastic manner. Quizzes are confusing. Instructions for paper are clear but is a very tough grader. This class shouldn't be a nursing requirement. The SON needs to take course evaluations/feedback and concerns seriously. 
Dr. Newton's expectations are clear, but my issue is with her teaching ability & harshness with grading. Even following the corrections she made on my rough draft, I almost failed (3.8 gpa). The amount of information she expects in the paper is unrealistic, since the maximum length is 8 pages including the title & reference pages. Do not recommend.
Dr. Newton is very knowledgeable about research, but isn't great at teaching. She isn't able to simplify the material if you have trouble understanding it, and is an overly critical grader. I utilized the feedback she provided on my rough draft, and she found more wrong with my final draft. I've always been a very strong writer but barely passed.
Very confusing and unclear about directions for the final paper.  Wants you to be detailed but won't read your paper if it goes over the page limit.  She messed up on the grading on one of my assignments and said I could meet with her but she would not change my grade. This class is a waste of time for the nursing program.  
Despite Professor Newton's bad reviews, I actually really liked her. She is a tough grader, however her expectations are crystal clear, so it is really up to you on what grade you get. The quizzes are not too difficult and based on what she explains in lecture so be sure to go. The final paper is not too bad, she gives you the exact edits u need!
Didn't use the textbook. Pay attention in lecture and you'll pass her quizzes easily. She'll give EC for random things. Very specific about the final paper-you can turn in a rough draft as many times as you want before the final is due. I got a 99.7% on my paper after a few edits and two meetings with her. Address her only as Dr. Newton!!!
She gives 3 quizzes which are directly from her lectures - do not worry about the book. Follow her directions to a T and you'll be fine for the final paper. She may seem intimidating but she is just super straightforward and blunt. If you ask her to explain something, she is willing to help. Very prompt on emails too!
Sarah Newton is hands down the WORST professor ever. She is a very harsh grader and she sends degrading emails to her students. She makes you purchase a bunch of textbooks and tests you on ridiculous things. I am normally a straight A student and I almost failed this class because of her. STAY CLEAR of Sarah Newton. Trust me.
I was told Professor Newton was a horrible professor and that she grades very harshly. Despite her coming off as intimidating at first, overtime you realize she is just passionate about research. She truly wants you to succeed and gives you helpful feedback for every assignment. If you want to do well in this class, I recommend taking her!
Professor Newton gets a bad rep, I was warned about how hard of a grader she is and how strict she is. That was not my experience at all, she comes off as strong and stern, but after a few lectures it's obvious that she has a good sense of humor and wants us to do well. She sets clear expectations and if you follow them it's fairly easy to do well.","Professor Newton gets a bad rep, I was warned about how hard of a grader she is and how strict she is.

412,"The class is so easy, you might not be able to handle it. It's a little frustrating that he uses the class to just tell you his opinions and stories and you'll feel like you wasted your time with this class, but he's an easy grader and interesting sometimes, so it will work out. Not many grades at all.
He's the nicest guy ever! TA's are  life savers in this class and due dates are always pushed back if you need them to be. Don't get behind tho. If you need help the teachers and TA's are more than willing to help you out. Hanson makes lots of jokes, lame jokes. But they're funny because of how lame they are. Great guy.
His part of this course dealt mostly with the computers, and while they are hard to understand at first, they're real helpful when plotting maps.  Grades are really leaned towards the students.  No book, all exercises, about 12 of them, the final ones just take a bit more time and thought
This class is the easiest and hardest A ever. Show up to class and deal with the frustration that is having NO instruction whatsoever. The grading is so lenient that you would be a fool not to ace this class.
Great prof. Funny, knows a great deal about programming.  Hard material. See the TA's and him durring office hours.
Very nice man.  The class itself is hard, but he does his best to make a complicated subject understandable.  He's a really nice guy, makes lots of nerd jokes.  If you go to his office hours because your program doesn't work, he'll help you make it work.  Really nice guy.
THis was a computer geography class.  The guy's cool, thinks he's funny, cracks himself up.  His jokes aren't too bad.  Nice enough, but boring as hell classes.  DO NOT TAKE IF DON'T LIKE PROGRAMMING@!  I didn't know a thing about it, I didn't do so well.
difficult class but you will pass, find someone who took it already and you will be well off. Don't take if not required.  Cool teacher, kinda cute.
this class is hard so far. anyone who has suggestions on what the tests are like that took this course, help out please. any info for this class would help!
Great professor, class is easy if you have some programming experience
good prof, class is VERY hard, funny guy...lots of quotes!
Awesome teacher, very funny, nice guy. Class is tough. Only take if required to.
prof is cool but don't take this class if you don't have too
A very nice guy, if you don't like programming you're not going to like it
Great Professor; Very Helpful; Challenging
hard class, if you don't like programming stay away, helpful prof
Tests & quizzes difficult.  Very helpful, good sense of humor
A great teacher. Clear and precise, but overall course is hard.
Great guy.",Great Professor; Very Helpful; Challenging
413,"I was contemplating whether or not this was a History class or a Political Science class because this guy would not shut up about his own political views that no one cared about. Words can't describe the stuff that would come out of this guys mouth. If you want a class that bashes the president the whole time then this class is for you. Waste.
Hard class. Lots of reading, films, long boring lectures. The class topics are very interesting but unfortunately they are presented in such a bias manner that it is difficult to really enjoy learning about the subject matter. Learned a lot tho about events that I was unaware of.
Professor Alchon is the BEST. I never write review on here, but I loved this class so much I had to. This was one of the most eye opening courses I've ever taken, and the discussions/ documentaries were fascinating. It was a lot of work, but all of it was interesting and Alchon is so helpful! Take his class!
Maybe the best class I have ever taken and that isn't hyperbole. Prof Alchon educates you on a variety of important issues throughout the course that are all equally heartbreaking, interesting and shocking. This class changed my worldview in many different ways and I genuinely wish every student who goes to UD takes this class. Prof Alchon is great
By far my favorite professor at UD. Gives great feedback on assignments and genuinely cares about his students and what he's teaching. Class was discussion based on documentaries and readings and would go out of his way to help.
Dr. Alchon was by far one of my favorite professors I've had at UD. he is really passionate about the material, and loves it when his students are too. if you put in the effort, it will pay off. Alchon wants his students to succeed and gives excellent feedback!
HIST400 was the best discussion-based course I have taken at UD. We read a decent amount because it is a capstone course, but each book was valuable. Every week, we have a weekly 1-2 page review of the books or a book review essay (four 4-5 page essays based on book options he provides). Dr. Alchon is a hard grader, but deeply cares about students!
Super great guy whos passionate about the material and wants to see younger people learn. Only problem I had was that his exams were a pretty hard but if you set aside a few hours for each one you should be fine. Definitely take him if you have the chance!
plays a lot of movies and videos then lectures for a bit. Tests are all multiple choice but are challenging at times.
Awesome dude, well-versed, and genuinely cares about his students and what he teaches. Mostly lectures and films but he regularly checks in for questions or thoughts. Tests aren't too bad if you pay attention and study a little. Definitely would recommend this class to those interested in American history
Prof. Alchon is a super nice guy who truly cares about what he is teaching. His exams; however, are extremely difficult. The lectures feel long and he plays a lot of videos. Your grade is 75% exams and the other 15% is a mix of your final paper and attendance.
Guy is inspirational and brings speakers in that might change your life. However, it isn't an extremely easy A. You get a list of vocab to study before every test, and the tests are short and multiple choice. The questions are somewhat difficult though. I wouldn't buy the books because they aren't necessary.
After registering for this class, I was scared by all the bad reviews!  Prof. Alchon was great, he really cared about everyone's success, and was straightforward with information on tests.  Only 3 exams and 1 paper, and he ended up dropping our lowest exam score.  I never did the readings and finished with B+.
Professor Alchon is so passionate about what he teaches and makes it interesting to learn. This class was by far my favorite class I've taken at UD. He made me really want to learn about history and made me really think. Readings are helpful & class is necessary to pass. 
Coming from someone who had less than zero interest in the course work at the start of the semester, I have to say that Professor Alchon made this class worth taking.  I only took it to fulfill graduation requirements, but his discussions were interesting and informative, and I genuinely didn't mind going to his class.  He's an incredible professor
Guy is easily the most passionate and knowledgable professor I've had. A lot of reading but class was discussion/videos every week. Wants to help students and make an impact as much as any teacher at UD. Great guy, challenging class, but you'll do well if you put in a little effort.
Professor Alchon really cared about everyone in his class.If you had any question or problem, he'll be more than willing to help you. Also,the readings were very interesting and educational. Take him if you can!
I created this account just so I could write a review for Professor Alchon. I cannot say enough amazing things about Professor Alchon. He is so passionate for what he teaches and you will learn more in his class than any other, I promise. He wants you to succeed so badly and will help in every way he can. He is an amazing man.
Professor Alchon's class is by far the easiest class I have taken at UD. He makes it clear to his students that he wants them to succeed and goes out of his way so that they do so. Attendance not mandatory. Definitely recommend. All you need to do is study his outlines of the exam and its a very easy A. He's also very nice and easy going.
he seemed like a cool professor at first but the exams seemed to be based off the most random facts that were just in his head. the exams varied in difficulty but were generally unpredictable. he played movies most days instead of actually teaching. don't buy the books.",By far my favorite professor at UD. Gives great feedback on assignments and genuinely cares about his students and what he's teaching. Class was discussion based on documentaries and readings and would go out of his way to help.
417,"I genuinely feel really bad for any new students that want to go into computer science and have to take this guy. This is supposed to be an entry-level course, but if this class was the first time I have ever touched programming, I would have instantly dropped the course and switched majors. Take him for an easy grade, avoid if you want to learn.
He hands out free As for everyone and their grandma, but terrible teacher
Though he may lack sometimes in clearly teaching the material.  He makes up for it with his understanding and his willingness to work with students on getting a good grade.
I love Mr. Kotman. Very nice, caring, and loves to teach us and interact with students. He's very lenient on grading and turning in assignments on time, but he might go a little fast for the material presented. All in all a great experience.
Had to learn most course material on my own, taught very little. Did not grade any assignment until last minute after finals. Very stressful and unorganized.
Avoid this professor if you are taking CIS 162. You will basically be self teaching yourself everything.
Larry has no clue how to work code let alone teach it to students. In taking this course expect to teach yourself everything.
I am a freshman and Grand Valley and have had Larry for about 2 weeks, he is an absolutely horrible teacher, he is completely clueless about computers and technology. I would not take this class if you are interested in computer science. He made me reconsider my major. 
I didn't go to class once this semester after the first day nor talk to him....and I still got an A, if this doesn't tell u anything idk what will...
Worst prof I've had in 4 years and it's not even close. I was told to take this class to help a bit with upcoming grad school. I've learned almost nothing. No notes, little communication, and boring and aimless ""lectures"". I've never posted on this site but felt obligated to say avoid at all costs.
Take the class if you want an easy A. Very nice guy and is caring, BUT don't take him if you want to learn. Not ideal to have CIS162/163 with him if you are a CS major. Very important concepts are taught in those classes, and you NEED to have a good grasp on the concepts to survive the major/career.
Professor Kotman was excellent. He did a great job explaining the material, and he really put forth an effort to develop quality lessons. He was kind, caring, and was always available to answer questions and help solve problems after class or during office hours. He communicated effectively through email and through in class announcements.
Professor Kotman's CIS 160 is a very easy class to pass, but you will learn little to nothing. His lectures are all over the place and usually don't pertain to the content that you are currently working on. But besides all of this, Professor Kotman himself is a very kind man who seems to be very invested in his field.
Freshman year of college. Absolute worst experience ever. He seems to barely know how to even use a computer, and his teaching is inexcusable. Absolutely DO NOT take this class with him unless this isn't for your major or you have previous coding experience. The only pro I can think of is that he's nice.
Truly among the worst that Grand Valley has to offer. Do NOT take him for any classes, but certainly not a foundational course like 162. If you get stuck with him, be ready to rely on the textbook and external resources because he rambles, gets confused, and legitimately does not understand how to use a computer. Awful, awful professor.
He assigned us 3 projects. We could only get A's if we completed all three perfectly, and he gave no tests. He often refused to help with code we were stuck on, saying ""if I tell you what to do, you won't learn."" (I learned close to nothing). Repetitive lectures on random topics. Had us follow Microsoft tutorials instead of really teaching content.
It was very frustrating to have this professor. He rambles a lot and a couple of times, he picked up his phone during our class while he was lecturing. I did not feel like he understood what he was teaching.
He's ok
Professor Kotman is a humble guy. He's very nice, but not a good teacher. If you need a professor who will answer your questions and help you out he is not the one. His answers will usually not answer your questions and he likes to ramble. He also brings C# example code to a Java class. Facepalm. You will be on your own for the most part.
Final grades are due in less than 24 hours and half of my grades are not inserted yet. Barely taught us anything the whole semester, including giving us the majority of our code for assignments, and left us very ill prepared for the final exam. Literally the hardest exam I've ever taken in my life. A very nice guy but take someone else","Had to learn most course material on my own, taught very little. Did not grade any assignment until last minute after finals. Very stressful and unorganized."
418,"Very nice guy! I loved him as a professor even though I didn't get the best of grades...
Donovan is a pretty easy prof. Very few assignments.  It's not always clear when assignments are due or what is expected, but if you just ask he'll let you know.  He also helps a lot with papers if you ask.  Definitely the prof to take if you want an A
He is a super nice guy, but his class has no structure whatsoever. Our class got so behind all of the other classes and we never even looked at the fourth essay in class, we had to do it all on our own. No clear guidelines were ever given on the papers.
Professor Donovan was a nice guy  but his instructions were not very clear. Many of the students didn't understand what to write until after they saw a writing consultant. If you don't feel you are a strong writer take a different professor.
Very chill but does not give much instruction at all. I would not recommend him unless you can write well on your own.
I would not take this professor if you do not know anything about writing. He is not clear at will with his directions that he is giving. The comments he gives you on papers that you hand in to him are useless because you can't read his writing whatsoever.
Professor Donovan is an really cool guy. He helped me a lot with my essays and gave good ideas and critiques.  I thought he was hilarious.  He also lets you out early.  I recommend him definately.
He is a funny and very very down to Earth guy. He really lets you move at your own pace and he gives great feedback on your writing. I've always hated writing but he made me like this class. Plus, we always got out of class super early
Most pointless class ever and I'm pretty sure Prof Donovan believes it too. The topics he gives you are hard to write on and this should be an online class. He never tells you what he wants and is very unclear on what the assignment is.
Extremely easy prof. I'm terrible at writing and yet it was the only class I got an A in. He has small writing assignments throughout the class but they don't need to be done and don't count for your grade at all. With the papers, he is VERY unclear about what he wants you to do so you just write whatever and if it sounds decent at the end,you pass
Not a good professor. He rarely shows up to class and when he does, nothing gets accpomplished. It is impossible to know what he wants from his students. Bad Professor!
I loved having professor Donovan!He really cares about his students, and it always willing to help and work with you. He is very knowelegable, and taught me some great tips for writing that will last a life time... I am sad that people rated him so badly. I thought the experience was great!
This guy has no clue what he wants in his class! I mean it is a very easy class, dont get me wrong, but if you actually want to learn somthing, dont take his class.  If you are looking for an easy A go for it!! It wont help you in wrt150 thats for sure!!
WOW, this guy is very useless. You never know when due dates are and you never really know what he wants from each paper. He grades pretty hard, of course, because you never know what he's looking for. Although i feel bad for the poor guy, he tries to makes jokes.. and no one laughs.. lol
he seriously like never would show up for class like once a week and he wouldnt even tell us when class was canceled. no one understood the assignments so basically it was writing three papers on your own. he is not a good teacher at all. if you arent a good writer to begin with you will not do good in this class with him!!
Did not like him at all. He is really unclear in what he wants. The class was a joke
This was the easiest class I have ever taken. He is a great, laid back guy. If you like structure, then you won't like this class.
Class was really easy, half of them were cancelled and the other half were less then an hour long. Just write the papers and turn them in, dosn't even matter if they are late, and you will get an A.
What an amazing English Professor...His subtle irony is so cool. I look foreward to the day Brad Donovan publishes a great American novel. He has a wealth of funny, crazy, stories and events to speak of, carry on Prof. Brad Donovan.
Not helpful one bit, very unclaer on things and due dates. Nice guy though, funny, easy class.","Not helpful one bit, very unclaer on things and due dates. Nice guy though, funny, easy class."
419,"If you behave, ask questions, do your work, and show some interest in the subject, she is a great teacher. She takes no nonsense, however, so don't expect to breeze by her.
Pretty easy as long as you did well in Ling101. She can sometimes be nasty but for the most part she's not bad at all. The class is very well rounded, with weekly homeworks, pop quizzes, and three exams. Semester is broken up into phonology, morphology, and syntax. Shouldn't be hard for a ling/cogsci major to get at least a B+/A-
Such an easy class - if you took LING101 you can take this with your eyes closed. Vogel tends to over-elaborate on some slides in powerpoints and the class drags when she does. However, she knows what she's talking about and always answers questions when they're asked. Just don't challenge her - even if you're right, you're wrong.
Class is somewhat interesting. She really cares about linguistics. *Try to get a TA who speaks English as a first language!!
very mean person. please never register for her course. the lecture is very easy but the assignments are not. her teaching is clear but that's because she only teaches the easiest stuff..
The lectures are extremely helpful and clear. I attended every one and barely needed to study for the tests. The discussions are a waste of time generally, although thats where attendance is taken. My TA (Lan Kim) was more frustrating than helpful. There is a ton of extra credit. 2 tests total but most of the grade is from homework.
So boring and not at all helpful
Easiest class ever. As long as you keep up with the homework and go to lecture, you are sure to get an A. Lots of extra credit opportunities to bring your grade up too
The lectures with her are very boring, but the TAs really help you to understand the material during discussion. I found the class quite easy and interesting, but the later half was quite boring. The tests are just like the homeworks. 30% midterm, 30% final, 30% hmwk, 10% participation... nothing really to worry about.
I didn't think the class was that bad. The slides she used has all the notes you need for her tests and hw, and the discussion section works on the same kind of problems as the the assigned hw. Only thing I thought was weird were the 2 discussion q. we needed to send the TA the day before discussion which were never really answered.
Hard class and way too much homework that was just annoying to do. Boring teacher to listen to and just plain painful to go to class
This was the most pointless and boring class I have ever taken.
I'd tell you what a wonderful class this is and that the professor is phenomenal...but I'd be lying.
Words cannot describe how utterly stupid and pointless this class is. The teacher is boring and focuses on the most useless information. Watch out they think their subject should be a science.Its ridic.I don't know how anyone could dedicate their lives to the trivial pursuit of transcribing words and drawing language trees.Avoid like the plague
Lectures and discussion sections are equally boring.  Pay attention because the course moves quickly and the tests and homework can be tricky.
harder than expected...tests are very tricky...discussion sections help but overall hard class (that is for a first time ling class) too much information to memorize
Good professor--native english speaker and very helpful.  Take her section!
If you like the material, you will do well.  Type out her notes and read along in class.  Her notes are helpful and outline the test material well.  Tests can be a little tricky...but study and you should get an A.  She is very helpful if you go to her with a positive attitude about the subject.
Pay attention in disc.b/c that is where you will learn everything thats on the exams. You only get one hw assignment per week, and if u split it up with your group members then it comes down to each person doing only ONE problem. So not a lot of work if u divide it up like u are supposed to!
Boring lectures.  Don't go to them, just print out the notes.  The discussions aren't helpful either, I learned all the material myself just from doing the homework, which is collected every lecture.",Good professor--native english speaker and very helpful.  Take her section!
422,"Favorite teacher so far at UD.  He is the man.  Explains everything and is open to questions which he knows the answer too, I promise. Gives you opportunity to maintain a higher grade by giving you the option to take a final consisting of the new material or you can take a cumulative one.  Do Not Avoid.
St. Pierre is hands down the best professor at UD. Makes class enjoyable with humor and does an outstanding job teaching the challenging material. If you come to class with book and study the homework/class notes, you should do great in this class.
one of the best i have had at delaware - funny, and keeps the class interesting; tough material but he makes it clear.
St. Pierre is the man. Class is tough though, you need to attend pretty much all lectures. Exams are straight forward, some questions straight from homework problems. Doing the HW problems is a must. You will need the textbook for 315 and 316. 3 exams, final can be either 3 chapters or 12 chapters of work
He is a pro, made class a piece of cake with his sense of humor, he should teach ACCT316 as well. Dont miss him
great teacher - real liberal and funny too!
you have to go to class. he's laid back , doesn't collect homework, so its optional but keep up with it and you'll pass the exam no problem. great prof. if you get the chance to take him def. do
2 exams-worth 100 point. final- either take cumalative worth 100 points, or 30point final on last 3 chapters. very straitforward. tests are easy, provided you practice the hw.  if you want to do well, just do your hw.
TAKE HIM!! Material is hard but he makes it easier and as long as you understand the hw problems then you'll do fine on exams. He is the best teacher for 315!! dont make the mistake of taking anyone else
no structure? 2 days per chapter, 1st discussing material & 2nd going over HW, his tests are EXACTLY like the hw, if you understand the book problems you'll destroy the tests, if you can't pass his tests you shouldn't be an acct major, his non-cum final was 3 questions straight from hw problems, just the info was changed slightly, great professor
I have no clue what other people are talking about. His tests are so random and have nothing to do with the hw or lectures. Hardest acc't class I have yet to take and nearly immposible to do well. He is fair though and generally cares about the student. Take him if you don't like structure.
LOVE him. Not easy, not hard. Very funny and clear with material. P.S. he is hot.
Greatest accounting prof ever.  Do all the homeworks and you will kill the tests.  Go to class so you can be appropriately prepared for acct316 b/c the homework won't teach you everything.
Do the homework, b/c the exam ?'s are exactly the same if not easier! It's not neccessary to go to class. Take him, he's fair.
3 things: mullet, cowboy boots, and rams.  He makes 315 very clear and he's funny in class.
ok
One of the best teachers I've ever had.  Learned alot in his class.  Tests are exactly like homework problems and not very difficult.  Put this #1 on your priority list because you don't want to get stuck with Paretta!!!
Tests are the exact same thing as the homework. So, if you do the homework, you should be guaranteed at least a C. Really funny guy too. Nice boots.
I Love St. Pierre! He is one of the best Accounting teachers.
St. Pierre = Biggest **** in the world.   Do yourself a favor and take him","St. Pierre is hands down the best professor at UD.

423,"She is very awkward and corny in class,, I spent a lot of time pity laughing and feeling sorry for her when my classmates were clearly unamused. That being said, the class itself was boring, but essential. It is waaaay too hard for a gen ed.  She told us that ""This class should be a priority"" Its a gen ed, it is no-one's priority.
No study guide for tests, lecture can be extremely frustrating if you don't read the book later, and breezes past certain topics. Honestly too hard for a gen ed course! Don't take if you're not a Geology major basically!
Boring lectures, no study guide or even a review, awfully worded test questions you probably don't even have in your notes, in-class work you can't make up.  Count how many times she says the word ""sediment"", it's the only way to make it through class.
Prof. V. was ok. She is a very kind person during class and is funny, but can be cold occasionally when asking questions or rude to the kids who are having a hard time grasping the subject. Her exams are super hard and the homework wasn't explained very well most of the time. She also offers 30 points extra credit.
Class was incredibly difficult for a gen-ed entry level geography course. Tests were the hardest I've ever taken, and questions were based on very small details barely mentioned in lecture. Unless you have a solid background in geography, I would avoid this prof.
She makes lecture and lab very entertaining with corny jokes but when it comes to tests there very hard. She also tests you on things she says and write on the board not what is mainly based in the book, so pay attention in lecture and take good notes!
DO NOT TAKE! If you know nothing about geology and have no care for it, do not take this as your gened.  Literally impossible, even with studying for the exams and never missing a class, I ended up with a C+.  She gives you so much work, and homework is graded on correctness versus completion.  Tests=impossible. Field trip to mine=terrifying! BAD!!
Videtich loves geology, shes goofy, and explains most things fairly well.  Her exams though are pretty hard.
She obviously loves what she does, and she made geology more interesting to me. She even takes you on fun field trips. It takes a lot of studying notes to get a good grade, and it's definitely important to attend lecture even though she doesn't take attendance.  Overall a fun class.
Extremely helpful and made the class material interesting.  While the demonstrations seemed unnecessary at times, they helped you remember the material come test time. Overall, a great professor that loves what they do
She is very enthusiastic, helpful and loves what she teaches. Many students have a hard time with her tests but if you attend all of the lectures, take good notes, study those notes and read the chapters you should be fine. I highly recommend her. Make sure to attend all of the lectures because she often gives little quizzes that are easy points!
Pat's tests were very hard, but she made the lectures and labs fun and interesting. She was very funny and if you put effort into the class you will pass easily.
Pat's tests are DIFFICULT. Simply, if you don't study, you're not going to get a good grade. Putting her tests to the side, She's a GREAT lady, INCREDIBLY funny, very intelligent and she wants everyone to learn. I CHANGED MY MAJOR TO GEOLOGY BECAUSE OF THIS CLASS. It's tough but very rewarding!!
Although I did learn a lot from this class, it was extremely hard. Tests are multiple choice, however each question is worth 4 pts, so if you miss more than 8 or 10 you're in trouble. Also, when she says extra credit won't save your grade, she's right...don't even bother!
Wow...this was one of the hardest classes I have ever taken, and it's a 100 level class! She's not a horrible teacher, but she packs an insane amount of information into each class period, and she is not the most fair grader. Again, she's not horrible, but I would take a different professor if you aren't a Geology person!
This is the hardest professor I've ever had. She packs WAY too much info into one class and her tests are nearly impossible. She doesn't give study sheets and you can't keep previous exams to study for the CUMULATIVE final. If you don't have to, don't take this professor
AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS. Seriously unless you have a passion or understanding for rocks AVOID. Taking the tests was like trying to read a different language. BY FAR the worst prof. ive ever had. Way to much work especially for rocks. Im doing you a favor STAY AWAY!
She has this impeccable ability to put anyone no matter how interested to sleep during her lectures. Perhaps it was because it was a three hour class but every time I stepped in that class I couldnt help but doze off. She knows anything that you would have questions on but her tests are extremely difficult. But she does have extra credit to help.
class was sometimes fun but she never helps and makes you feel dumb and cuts you down when you ask something. study more than 3 hours for her tests because they are insanely hard
She is awsome! She is funny and has very good notes.  Willing to answer any question with out making you feel stupid! I wish I could have her for more classes!","This is the hardest professor I've ever had. She packs WAY too much info into one class and her tests are nearly impossible.

424,"Prof. Haberkorn was great! He was one of those men who you could learn more from hearing stories about him and his beagle rather than lectures on his class. He was also rather old and walked as if he was a newborn deer on ice. Aside from all that, I learned a lot in his class. He also never made mistakes on grading tests or papers which was good!
I signed up for this because I needed a fine arts INST. I read the reviews on him and was looking forward to a pleasant and easy experience. While the class was an easy A with reading the textbook, he was grumpy and constantly insulted the class. Maybe it would have been different not at 8 AM...
Trippy and fun.  Loved it, don't worry about the grade he'll meet you half way.  He wants students to learn.  One funny and cool prof.
there is a lot more to writing successful music than what can be learned from a book. this is his speciality. i had many a good conversations with him and have used what i learned about life, music and myself to progress as a composer.
He's a really nice guy. Some corny jokes here and there, but all profs have those. Lectures could get a bit dull at times, and some of the info is on the test, but go to class read the text and you should do fine. GREAT at piano!!
EASY...I had no clue about music or anything and still aced the class. He keeps things interesting and exposes you to lots of different music too and kept things pretty interesting. He talks about his days at Julliard with Robin Williams a lot too, lol.
I was dreading going into this class but he made it enjoyable and interesting.  If you need to fill and INST I would recommend it.  Tests are straight forward.
Had a blast in december term class...not an easy thing to do.  Very memorable.
He is pretty good, makes jokes a lot about his dog.
Don't learn much, but usually fun.  However, mood swings and temper tantrums can ruin your day.
Very fun teacher and very intelligent.  Class is great too!!
Very fun, possibly the best IS instructor at OC.  He realizes that most people are there because they have to be, not because they want to.  Funny! Often rambles on about fairly humorous topics (like his dog)(makes the class go faster!).
He is nice, but the class is insanely boring.  For some reason he puts out his religious views in a music class.  Its not needed.
Personally, I think he is God's (or gods') gift to music.  This guy is so intelligent, that I'm oddly attracted to him.
he is a teacher that you really don't learn much from, but is really funny.
Good Teacher, a little sporatic and hard to follow sometimes, but does think he's God's Gift to Music.","Prof. Haberkorn was great!

425,"I think that Al is a great professor. If you want to learn about lighting, Al is who you want teaching you! The classes are very relaxed, yet hands on. I took this class pre-COVID so I got to work with peers on lighting plots and getting extra time on the lighting board when I needed. He's understanding and kind- just put in effort and you're good
Get ready to read! Al is a really great professor with lots of knowledge of theatre. He lectures a lot and sometimes rambles, but because I love the subject so much, I really didn't mind. Some of the plays you read are really weird, but it gives you something to talk about in the next lecture.
Very poorly suited to an online class. Talks a lot and makes you watch/read a lot of time-consuming things which are, ultimately, not even on/adjacent to the tests. Very few assignments. Never clearly communicates what he wants in assignments or when things are due. Graded almost nothing until the very end of the semester, so good luck guessing.
very boring, literally fell asleep through all his lectures. If you don't want to spend money to see the two play required for this class forget about taking this course. find another class that isn't so boring.
Al is the best professor that I had my freshman year and he makes things easy and relatable. Sure he can ramble sometimes but he is truly a wonderful professor.
Boring class and he rambled. You'll have to go see performances at the GVSU theatre and write reviews on them, but that's fairly easy. The tests can be tricky. They're multiple choice, true/false, and essay. The reviews he gives don't help at all, and he expects you to remember minor details. He does curve tests which helps. I don't recommend him.
VERY BORING! His lectures do not correspond with his tests. Puts questions on tests that weren't even covered in the chapters assigned. A lot of movies that will put you to sleep, only watches the beginning and expects you to know everything about the play. Relates everything to sex...(notice no pepper by his name) TRY TO GET A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR!
Oh so boring.  I slept and read a few extra books throughout lectures.  I thought he was unqualified at the beginning of the class; but he seems to know his stuff.  Lectures are boring.  I'm sure part of it was the material this class covers, but he could have done more with it.  Did I mention his lectures are boring?  Well they are. Very much so.
Al certainly knows his stuff, but he's also a bit...awkward. He talks about sex every single class period. Really, he always manages to find a way to do it. As long as you follow the guidelines to your analysis you'll be fine...he can be a tough grader though. I went into explicit detail and managed to get an ""A"" on each analysis and in the class.
I hated this class. It honestly made me change my major. He was incomprehensible, rambled, and went on and on about useless things. The material itself was interesting, but he sort of killed it for me. Take a different professor!!
Cant stand this teacher or class... horrible lectures, nothing makes sense, and the tests are rediculous... none of the answers off review sheet are even on the tests! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! One of the least comprehensible teachers i have ever had.
easy class easy professor, three tests, with really good study guides, everything on the guides is whats on the test, no tricks. two papers on plays you have to go to but relatively easy grader i dont think the teacher really matters for this class but shiefeld was easy
al, al, al. what can you say about al? well he's nice and all and pretty understanding, but its a guarenteed boring class for the most part. his lectures are a tad mind numbing, but its possible to pass this class without a TON of effort. try to keep up on plays or at least summaries of them, and joke around a lot with him, he's fun then.
I got an A, but I hate him! His lectures are horrible. He wanders off in what he is talking about. You watch a lot of movies, but never the entire thing. The only way to get a good grade is the extra credit. He is extremely slow and getting things back. It's a theatre appreciation class- I came in liking theatre, now I hate it. TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!!
Al is a good guy!  He is a great teacher and he really knows his stuff, though he does go off on these far fetch tangents.  I recommend Al to anyone who has a love for lighting or even theatre.
super easy class, kinda boring but hey i dont like theatre.  guy babbles off on tangents quite often, but if you read the book and study you're all set, papers are easy (goto a play, write about it, your good)...
BORING!!!! AND HE TAKES ATTENDANCE. RUN....
good guy, expects a person to not be stupid and to do what little work he requiers.  realy loves what he teaches and has the expirience too.  he can't see things that arn't close to his face.","VERY BORING!

426,"Great teacher who will be missed by all who knew him.
He passed away Jan. 2021.
By far the best teacher I had at RCBC. There is no professor funnier than him. Has no problem explaining things to you, likes to make jokes. Anyone who can take a good joke should take his class, everyone had a nickname in my class, everyone did something funny through the semester and got called out on it! I'd sit through his class again anytime!
Professor Hammil is absolutely awesome! His lectures are great and you really learn the material. I have him for psychology of adjustment and human sexuality and I have already learned so much in the half way point of the semester. He cares about his students. I highly suggest to take him! Fair work and you have one test a semester. He's great!!
The best teacher I have or ever will have. Mr. Hammill, one of the original professors at BCC, is an incredible man with an infectious personality. His stories and experience in the field are truly unbelievable. You'll take something away that besides the content of the course. Oh, and you'll never use the book for any of his classes: I had three.
best professor I ever had!!
best mother fer ever
I have had him for 5 different Psych classes and he is GREAT!
One of the best professors I ever had. I am still inspired by him more than 15 years later. As a college teacher myself I could only strive to be half as good as him.
love him
BEST CLASS EVER! He is by far one of the greatest teachers ever. He makes it so interesting and he will always keep you laughing. The class isn't that hard at all, take good notes, and study for the tests. They're not too hard but if you don't study it can be hard. TAKE THIS TEACHER YOU'LL REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T!
THE BEST TEACHER EVER!!  I cant imagine taking a psych class with anyone else, ill die. The tests can be tricky but if you study all ur notes ull get at least a B. Take good notes. He'll repeat anything for you. He's so funny and relates everything to everyday life! He tell stories of his family that i'll remember 4ever!TAKE HIM! U WONT REGRET!
Mr. Hammill is by far the best teacher i have ever had. his style is incredible and i love the way he puts things. simply, but he still gets you thinking. i would recomend that everyone take one of his classes.
he's definitely the best teacher i've had so far at bcc..i love the stories he tells plus he makes the class so much fun rather than a prof who does nothing but lecture with no enthusiasm..im definitely going to try and take another class of his because he is so awesome
HE IS AN AWESOME TEACHER! HE TELLS STORIES AND JOKES LIKE CRAZY.  HIS TESTS ARE HARD, BUT BEARABLE IF YOU STUDY.  DEFINITELY TAKE HIS CLASS YOU WILL LEARN ALOT AND HAVE FUN AT THE SAME TIME.
I've had Hammill for 2 classes so far. He is definately the best Prof. I have had in the 2 years I've been at BCC.
he is so funny one of the best get his classes early they are the first to fill up
Still think about him after 10 years!
Awesome Professor... you definitely should take him for PSY101, 102 or Human Sexuality
I had Hammill my first semester at college in 2001. I'll never forget him! He was so crazy and kept me interested every second. I loved all his stories, esp. the ones about his grandson. He's such a sweetheart.",he's definitely the best teacher i've had so far at bcc..i love the stories he tells plus he makes the class so much fun rather than a prof who does nothing but lecture with no enthusiasm..im definitely going to try and take another class of his because he is so awesome
431,"Easily one of the best professors I have ever had. She cares about her students and the field that she works in. She has great stories and hosts great lectures! I cannot rave enough about this professor. Definitely, if you get the chance, take a class with this professor.
A really inspirational teacher. She is kind and has really cool stories she brings to class. Really lecture heavy and gets off task on tangents, but at the end of class you feel like you learned something. The first exam was really long and hard, but overall class is interesting. 
She is one of the most caring profs ever. If you ever need help, go talk to her! She is so understanding and helpful. She says book is mandatory but u wont use! She grades really fairly and does not make this class as stressful as it seems it would be. She loves to get to know her students so reach out, she is a very nice and knowledgeable person!
Dr. Bailey is truly the best professor Ive ever had! She genuinely cares about each of her students and fills her lectures with her stories. She is always willing to help and even gives her home phone number so you can reach her whenever. If you have the chance to have her, you wont regret it!
simply the best
THE BEST PROFESSOR AT GV!! THE MOST AMAZING HUMAN BEING IVE EVER MET. If youre a CJ don't gradate without taking a class from her! She has amazing life stories that go with lectures, takes time to get to know every students name and things about them, she's also a great person to ask for future job or grad school references as well.
Dr. Bailey is an absolute ray of sunshine. Honestly, one of the best human beings. She is so inspirational and made me want to be a better person from just this one class. I will for sure look to have her again in the future.
Dr. Bailey is by far my fav prof at GV. She is such a good person and radiates inspiration. This class teaches so many valuable outlooks on life that everyone should know. Dr. Bailey always used past experiences to help us understand content. A few exams, journals and attendance is graded. This class was my fav and I'm so glad I had Dr. Bailey.
Kathy is incredible! Her lecture days could be slightly unorganized, but she posts the power points online. Not many assignments, just a couple tests and short journal assignments. Lots of opportunity for extra credit. She is so understanding, flexible, and forgiving, and truly cares about her students and wants to help. Definitely take her!
Dr. Bailey is an absolutely incredible professor. She cares deeply about every single student she has, and makes sure everyone is learning constantly, utilizing a variety of different ways to teach. She is friendly, open, and funny. Any concerns you have she is always willing to help. Definitely definitely take her as a professor.
Dr. Bailey is honestly the most amazing professor ever! I had the privilege of taking both of the two classes she teaches and would take every single class with her if possible. CJ420 was awesome; CJ 495 was only a 6week class so it was very compact but she does her best to make all of the work manageable. Don't pass up an opportunity to take her!!
If you are interested in CJ or something related, it'll be your loss if you graduate without ever taking a class with Kathy. I have taken 2 classes with her. My capstone and CJ 420. Both were great experiences.
I took Dr. Bailey for weekend class in CJ 420. She has an incredible amount of knowledge in the field and tells good stories. She is one of the kindest and fairest people you want to meet so long as you are honest with her about things. The first exam was difficult but she took feedback from students on it and changed up the format. Excellent prof.
Dr. Bailey is by far the best professor I have ever had the privilege of taking a class with. She is so kind and caring, yet funny and insanely knowledgeable. I was sad when her class was over; I thoroughly enjoyed her lectures and loved her as a person. The journals were kind of annoying and very personal, but I would take her again in a heartbeat
Dr. Bailey is so far my favorite professor. Even if you're not going into juvenile justice, she really inspires you to care more about that population. Exams are okay, but you do have to write a lot. So if you actually study, you should enjoy your time with her and get a good grade! Do purchase the small book, as she asks questions from there.
Dr. Bailey is the hilarious! This class however was exceptionally hard. You are only graded on 6 things. She uses a lot of past experience in her lectures and goes off on a tangent easily. Her power points aren't clear, they are choppy & hard to understand, but if you want a class where you will laugh a lot, take the Department Head, Dr. Bailey!
Dr. Bailey is by far the best prof I've had at GV. She cares so much about the class and she lets you know that each class. She has so much knowledge about the topic and its obvious when she is teaching. I would 100% take her again!! She's the best!
I absolutely love professor Bailey. She is fun and so intelligent. Lectures are far from boring. I hope to have the opportunity to her again. She clearly communicates her expectations. She has so much knowledge and experience to share, and does a great job doing so. 
Amazing class and prof. She really provided the most useful info. And challenged me to think....she made me want to learn...funny, passionate and so insightful....all this and so humble and caring. I would take her for very class. I consider her a mentor
Shes a nice woman and its a fun class but there was a little too much sharing opinions and stories not enough quality learning for me.","Easily one of the best professors I have ever had.

432,"If youre looking for an easy A please dont take this class. This class CAN be an easy A but youll have to do some studying. Professor Rogers is in no way a bad professor I personally just don't like the way she operates class. Theres 4 tests and about 2 1 point quizzes per class so skip class and miss quizzes your grade can slip fast.
Professor Rogers is a nice and caring professor. She shows a genuine interest and understanding of what she's teaching. She assigns a lot of reading and a lot is covered each class, so you should try to attend them. Your grade is primarily determined by 4 tests, so make sure to take them seriously. That being said, they are not all that difficult.
Very passionate and engaging lecturer who does a great job of making some complex and weird ideas easy to understand. There are four tests and the clicker questions as your entire grade. Fairly easy class where paying attention is rewarded. 
Easy class but extremely tough grader! A really sweet and kind person but old fashion and that hurts at times. Tests are 80% of your grade so forgetting the smallest thing can deduct a solid 2% of your grade. Don't take this class lightly and you should be fine.
I have learned nothing in this class, lectures are boring and she is a little quirky, goes on convoluted tangents and it is extremely hard to follow, HOWEVER, if you pay attention on the review day before the test then the tests (which are majority of the grade) are pretty easy. I didn't pay attention at all except for review days and have an A.
Barely anything to get graded on so its hard to keep ur grade up which sucks and this lady doesnt do extra credit
I like how shes very personable and overall a sweet lady
So sweet and cares about her students. Wacky but in a good way. Go to reviews for exams she will answer any question you have. A lot of papers are assigned but she gives you many topics to choose from, and you could easily write them just with what was talked about in lecture. One of my favorite philosophy professors.
She literally makes the class horrible. I was so excited to take this course and it felt like she didn't care at all. She is not there to help at all, refuses to give extra credit even though she knows her students are failing. In addition, she only gives 4 assignments, setting you up for failure.
Mrs. Rogers' class has a really poor implementation for online class (COVID-19), and because of this, I would never recommend anytime take this class until changes are made. All her class is, is watching her lectures that she recorded in 2016, 2 times a week. Each video is an hour and fifteen minutes, with poor audio that makes learning difficult
I had her during the pandemic and she didn't even teach us. She posted recorded lectures from 2016 and more recently edited slides so they didn't even match up. We did not have a single meeting face to face. The only grades were 4 Tests. I did like the material that was taught just not the way it was taught. Take the class in person not online!!
This is a sample email from this professor ""I continue to get requests for doing extra credit. I do not intend to change the evaluation procedures that I spelled out for everyone at the beginning of the semester, here in the last quarter. I realize this is being a tough time for everyone..."" Then ended with assessing the final grades, thedisrepect
Worst class imaginable, I am in my second to last semester and I have A's in everything else and I'm currently failing this class. There are 4 exams, no new formatted material, just shoved together garbage from past semesters. The sad thing is that she's getting paid a professors salary to use proctoru and upload old stuff. I am disappointed UD.
I am about to finish this course in fall 2020, so I took it all online and asynchronous due to COVID. Out of all the classes I'm taking this semester, this is by far my least favorite and most difficult. The entire grade is based off of 4 exams, THATS IT. Unless you really enjoy philosophy or learning about specific philosophers, don't take this.
Hard class, dry lectures, did not curve exams
Tests are the only things graded besides clicker scores which don't affect the grade enough. Anytime someone answers a question she says ""A for the the day"" and after the first few times you hear it your gonna want to never hear her voice again. Tests were hard and questions were worded poorly. Don't take this class as a breadth, not worth it.
This class was really interesting and Rogers is good at explaining the material and making the class interesting. As long as you take good notes and study, it should be an easy A. The Only thing is her powerpoints are super unorganized so you really have to listen during class and take notes according to what she says.
I took this as I thought it would be easy but it turned out to be one of the hardest classes ive taken at the university and ive taken organic chemistry so thats saying a lot.
4 Tests, Pay attention to slides and what specific philosophers think, as she will tell you in class and in textbook. Textbook for clicker questions which make up 20% of your grade. Other 80% split between 4 tests including final. Nice lady, not too hard
Rogers is a very nice teacher who clearly enjoys her subject. Unfortunately, that subject is Philosophy, which isn't a class I believe should be taught in a lecture-hall style. But it is. Pretty boring class, but if you take notes and follow the (very vague) study guides the tests aren't super difficult. I liked the teacher but the class is dull",Very passionate and engaging lecturer who does a great job of making some complex and weird ideas easy to understand.

433,"The worst professor I've ever had. His lectures are totally incoherent and unrelated to what is on the test. I took this as an easy Group D and resented every minute of it.
Prof. Shipman is a great guy but a horrible professor. He goes off on tangents about things that have nothing to do with the topic. Textbooks are pointless. The bright side is that tests are easy and don't require a lot of studying.
Take him only if you don't have to take 208
Harry Shipman was genuinely a terrible professor. He completely skipped essentially all the material he was supposed to teach to prepare us for Phys 208. Once I was in 208 I realized that he literally did not teach us basic Physics concepts or notation we needed to know for future Physics classes. We learned almost nothing the entire semester.
This class is a joke. Great GPA booster. It really doesn't matter if you read or not, as long as you pay attention to most of his lectures you'll be okay. He does give extra credit, but chances are you won't need it; even if you think you do.
Shipman was the most adorable professor ever and is super helpful! The class is super easy and there is like no work required! Take this class soo easy!!!!!!!!!
Harry was great.  Was extremely excited before this class and let me tell you, it lives up to it.  He is a deff a legend,its basically an hour and a half of Harry talking about how awesome he is!!  You should go to class because there are group activities but honestly you should just go to class to watch the legend.  TAKE THIS CLASSSSSS!!!  EASY A!
The legend Shipman. Probably the greatest teacher ever to live. His class is impossible to fail. He is hilarious to watch run around the classroom and he cares about all his students. Take with friends and have a good time.
Harry Shipman is amazing!!  He is the sweetest man you will ever meet.  He may be a little loopy but who cares!  He will answer any questions you have and really tries to keep people entertained in class.  He cares sooo much about his students and is really smart.  Take any class with him!!!
He is the MAN. This is literally the easiest class i have ever taken including middle and high school classes. Everyday you take a max to 1 page of notes. He is so funny, even though he tends to like girls alot more than guys. He runs around the class room and demonstrates using students. if you dont get at least an a- ur a moron, drop outta school
Teaches the class at a turles pace. Course overall is easy, 3 exams, group work thats it. People rarely went to class.
Harry Shipman is a legend. Anyone who doesn't find this class entertaining doesn't have a sense of humor. Who cares if you don't learn anything, for simply showing up every class you get a comedy routine and an A if your halfway smart. Take this class.
Just don't sign up for it. I was honestly very interested going in... coming out I learned nothing. He spends more time  telling us what we did yesterday (which was nothing) and what we are going to do ( again nothing except go over the list of what we are going to do again). He's a very nice man, just needs to actually teach.
I actually changed my major because of him AVOID him if you value your GPA
if he wants the make the class as dumb as he does, it should not be mandatory.  this way, if you do not like to be brought down to a 3 year old level, and already know the 1st grade level material you do not have to attend the class
Shipman is awesome. He really loves his profession and what he teaches. He's a real astronomer. He's fun and makes the class understandable for everyone, even people who aren't really into science. He also talks a lot about the ice skating that he does. Overall a great teacher!!!
BORING.  Class is taught at the elementary school level.  Since he likes that level so much, maybe he should go back and teach there.
He was definately the most entertaining professor I've had so far in college. He is one of the sweetest men I have ever met and is always willing to help his students if they take the time to ask. It's easy to get him to go off on tangents, and if you ask, he'll show you his ice-skating videos. He's great....easy B, at least.
I had him this semester, and the class was terrible, I mean, I understand that it is a 100 level class, but shouldn't we actually be taught something.  Or if he really wants to make the tests that difficult, then he really should learn how to teach at that level.
Harry is completely entertaining, but he should be teaching elementary to middle school instead of college. All you do is group work, have assigned groups and seats- doesn't take attendance but you have to sign to get credit for group work and thats where participation comes from. You won't learn anything & will have no desire to go to the class.","He was definately the most entertaining professor I've had so far in college.

434,"I love this prof! She is very caring and understanding. I struggled in PSY 300 and I was nervous about this class, but she was so kind about everything and really cared about her student's succeeding. The class itself is new so I think they will be adjusting things next semester. But definitely take her for 350 if you can. 
Such a kind and understanding professor. Changed the syllabus accordingly if the class wasn't understanding concepts/needed more time to complete things. About one worksheet a week (graded on completion/effort), a couple quizzes and labs. Cares more about your effort than being correct. If you struggled in stats with SPSS take this professor! 
She is super nice & fun to be around. but, the class itself was dreadful. You sit in a circle doing basically nothing for 2 hours straight. Its discussion-based so you don't learn anything. the books used were mostly elementary for the level we should've been at. It was disappointing to not get to discuss any psychology topics in a psy capstone
Had her a couple semesters ago. So sweet and will give you as much help as she can. Super understanding, if you need a deadline extended she will give it to you. Lectures were boring to me, I don't have the mind for a lot of research analysis/calculations. Very fair grader, got almost 100% on my final paper/research presentation. Just put in effort
Definitely take Dr. Smith if you have the opportunity to for PSY 400. She cares about her students a lot and it shows. She is very easy to reach when you need extra help and will extend due dates when needed.
The kindest professor! Expectations and explanations are not very clear, but still is a tough grader. Little instruction for the final paper which is half done in groups and half done individually. However, she is very nice and flexible with due dates. Very willing to meet with you outside of class and work with you to make sure you understand.
This professor is just so sweet. She wants her students to succeed. She is patient and very understanding. She did well with online learning as well. Definitely take her!
Literally the nicest and more understanding professor ever. Will extend due dates if you aren't understanding the material and has so many opportunities to meet with her outside of class. 11/10 would recommend this professor for PSY400 and any other class she teaches
On the downside, she assigned group work during online learning, which is a bad move. But she made up for it by being extremely flexible and understanding. She didn't have hard deadlines on nearly anything, which was nice. She also was very accessible, I've sent so many emails and she's responded within a couple hours every time. She clearly cares.
Took the 6-week spring course. Two papers for the whole semester which is not bad but they are slightly difficult to write just cause of the pandemic. Quizzes every week on lectures and reading for the week. Have questions email her she is more than willing to answer questions and explain concepts if you don't understand them.
Not many points in the class but the assignments are meant to pad your grade. She is very sweet and will accommodate you when needed. Will answer any questions and appreciates opinions and on-topic discussions in class- will even take time to talk about hot topics on GVSU and current events. Go to class bc she has 6 in-class writing assignments.
Dr. Smith is probably the sweetest professor you will meet. It is obvious that she cares so much about her students. She was extremely helpful, especially if you go to her office hours. If you don't understand something, she will work with you as long as it takes until you understand. Only negative thing is, paper and exam were very difficult.
Sweet, caring, knowledgeable professor. That being said, her grading was outrageous. Most of the course was spent meeting with your group and little time was spent learning material. There was one exam (most of the class did poorly) and a final paper. Little instruction was given for the paper, yet it was graded incredibly harshly.
Not sure why her ratings are so high. She really does care and seems to like what she does, but she isn't always clear on what she's teaching. There is a group project but really it's pretty much on your own, you write the intro together and then you are on your own for the rest. Tough grader, not very flexible hours to meet. tough class imo
Wow, there are endless nice things to say about Dr. Smith. She is an absolute angel and I would highly recommend her. Really cares about her students and is always there to help.
I'm so glad I took PSY 400 with C. Smith. She is very great at explaining things and will bend over backwards to help you whenever you need. No question is a dumb question. There is one group research paper due at the end of the semester and she gives you plenty of time to accomplish each part of it. There is one exam at the end also.
Professor Smith could be one of the best professor's I have ever had. The content was engaging and she made me truly want to come to class every single day! There wasn't a textbook for the course, but two very good books that were interesting to read! Exam's were very wordy, but she prepared us well for them.
Super friendly and you can tell she really loves her job! Wish I could have her in the future!
Professor Smith is hands down the best professor in the Psychology department. I took this class as an 8:30am and I am not a morning person, but she made me eager to come to class because the lectures were so engaging and interesting. There is no real textbook, just 3 small novels.
Dr. Smith is a tremendously educated on the information given in class. Not sure if I would take her again tho. A LOT of reading, including 3 novels and long online readings she assigns every class almost. Almost the whole grade is based off of 2 tests and a paper. Also, I disliked how much she subtly pushed her political view on class topics.","Dr. Smith is probably the sweetest professor you will meet. It is obvious that she cares so much about her students.

435,"Professor Hewitt is the SWEETEST! If I had to describe her in one word, I would say gracious. She is super understanding and cares about each student individually. On top of that, discussions are very interesting and she gives really good insight into the readings. There is a lot of writing and reading, but it's really not too bad.
Values and seeks your opinions and input, so be prepared and read the material. Very flexible and understanding if you are absent, late with a paper, etc. But don't try to take advantage of her, because she ISN'T stupid, just generous. Has a brilliant mind and an amazing knowledge of history, literature, and media. PROOFREAD YOUR WORK!!
Don't take ENG 335 with Hewitt. She does not have good time management. Nothing ever matched the syllabus. Her idea of class discussion is she poses a question and then tries to spin your answer to match her own. The readings were fine for the class. It's a lot of single page papers and two tests matching the stories to quotes from the text.
Do NOT take her class. Save yourself the extra ridiculous amount of work for an actual higher level class. If you don'd do the reading you'll be in trouble. She's very unorganized and unclear with her instructions and gave multiple papers and projects the last few weeks of the semester.
Avis is, by far, one of my favorite professors. She's sweet, kind, and overall understanding. She is willing to move essays and due dates in order for everyone to be as prepared as possible. Make sure you get to know her!
It may not seem like it at first, but Professor Hewitt is a great prof who really knows the material. She is passionate about it, and wants her students to understand. There aren't any tests or quizzes, but there are four papers. They seem intimidating at first, but she's not a super hard grader; just make sure to double check your grammar.
She assigns a lot of reading, but not too much for an English major. The real problem lies in her abuse of power. She asks personal questions, fails to turn off her cell phone ringer even during student presentations and final exams, and spends more time focusing on her interests than class content. She's sweet but completely unprofessional
While the content of the course wasn't too bad, the sexist and pseudo-racist comments made at certain novel characters weren't appreciated by this English major. Unfortunately I have to take another of her classes, but I don't look forward to it at all.
I hate giving Hewitt such a low rating, but I feel it necessary. She goes off on tangents. What appears on the surface as quirky and fun quickly becomes distracting. Her individual interests can take precedence over lecture, causing loss in topic focus.
Professor Hewitt is a sweet lady, but she is a bit scatterbrained and her lectures are all over the place. She takes forever to grade your papers, and the class is entirely based around her lectures of the short stories. She wants all of the papers written in a strange way, and you have to read them to the class.
Avis is a sweetheart and very knowledgable, you can tell she really cares. She's pretty disorganized and all over the place and likes the papers done in an oddly specific way. There's a lot of reading - a short story for every class. Discussions are usually interesting. Not a hard class if you put in the effort - Overall pretty O.K.
Professor Hewitt is a sweetheart! The class pretty much consists of her lecturing on the stories we read and going on the little tangents about the authors. There is quite a bit of reading but its all pretty interesting. The only grades are 3 critics on stories of your choice and 3 critical analysis's expanding on what we discuss in class.
She's an extremely kind woman and very passionate and intelligent about the subject matter. She's a little disorganized, her lectures are often all over the place, but you can still get a lot out of the class. If you like reading and discussing literature, this is perfect. She's super helpful over email as well and if you participate you'll be good
Extremely disorganized and unclear. We never knew when things were due, there were no rubrics for grading and criteria was completely unknown, and we could never accomplish all of what she intended in class because she would get very long-winded. Avis is very opinionated and it intimidated people into not expressing their thoughts.
Love Avis! At first I was a little unsure of her because she's can be a little overwhelming. You just have to nod along sometimes, but it makes the class interesting. If you put in the effort and follow the criteria, she is a fair grader. Very helpful over email. I would recommend Avis!
I view Avis almost as a grandmother. This woman is hilarious and her lectures never make any sense, but they are just so enjoyable. It's tough to know exactly what she wants, because she never really explains it, but if you email her a question about a paper she will basically write the thesis for you. If you participate often you'll be fine.
She has a ton of knowledge and loves to share it. Pay attention and do the reading, and note the things she repeats or likes about a text, they will be in on the final. If you enjoy learning about Literature she is great.
Very sweet and knowledgeable professor. She's definitely an acquired taste as far as lectures go. Several times she's gone off topic, which can be quite funny but we fall behind on material. Very few one-page papers but be ready to read a lot. Opinionated and semi-tough grader. Not too sure what I took away from the class but it was okay.
Extremely disorganized and we only got one paper back so its impossible to know what your grade is like. She asks lots of confusing questions about the reading that no one had an answer to. Also announced on the day of the final that she lost our final and made us right an essay that no one was prepared for.
Prof. Hewitt is a very fun-loving professor, but she can tend to be a little ADD in her lectures. She often gets off topic which causes us to get behind. Her assignments are very different than anything I've done: 1 page papers with very little format requirement. We bounce around in the literature very often and it can be a little hard to follow.","Extremely disorganized and unclear.

437,"DO EVERY SINGLE PRACTICE PROBLEM. It is the only way you will pass this class. She is very fast in the lecture and is very timid. Not very many examples in class. Prepare to teach yourself the content.
Quizzes every week. Only teacher teaching the STA220 classes this year (F22). Randomly gives out extra credit on certain practice problems. Goes fast during lectures and is sometimes hard to keep up. Kinda irks me when she just stares at you. Her syllabus does not have a schedule on it so you don't know when your exams are until she tells you. 
Terrible grader. Takes off massive amounts of points for very small details. Is extremely tough on grammar, will deduct points if she feels you could have used a better word. Will make 7 videos for one homework assignment. Hours and hours of videos per week, with terrible audio quality. She feels her class is the most important and it shows
Diann is a very tough grader. Her lectures are well explained, but if you do not study outside of class, you will not pass. I have never felt like such a mediocre student in my life, and I had to WORK for this B. She's very willing to help outside of class, so definitely reach out if you need. It will help you tons.
Her lectures were thorough and well explained. However, we didnt really use the textbook too much. I definitely suggest doing the practice problems. Theyre not required but super helpful!
Very easy A as long as you go to class and pay attention. She offers a lot of extra credit opportunities to boost your grade. Do not waste money on the textbook for this class I never used mine, and it had no effect on my grade. Very nice lady.
Professor Reischman was great. Her tests MIRROR the worksheets she gave out. You don't need to understand everything she writes down on the board, as long as you can do the worksheets and use the chart. You have to put the time in but it isn't very much. Other than that, sometimes she seems a bit scattered but is extremely nice.
Great prof. Notes are printed out and you just fill in the blanks. Gives good feedback on each quiz and test. Lectures were a little dry, but still 100% recommend. Notes are presented in an organized manner and you know what is going to be on tests. DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS (they directly resemble quiz questions) !!
Take any other stats professor.
She seemed like a nice enough woman, but just not that great of a professor. No matter how many lectures I went to, and how many hours I studied, I still ended up getting a low grade on the quizzes that you have every class. All of your grade is basically tests.
I loved this prof! She explains topics more than she expects students to know. There's weekly quizzes, but they're exactly like the non-required homework. She has fill-in-the-blank note packets. I studied for maybe an hour for each of the 2 tests and got A's on both. Just write everything down and don't have your phone out at all!
Extremely boring. Looks at you like you're stupid if you ask a question. Tests are really hard: studying doesn't help. Textbook is impossible to understand, created by GV professors and terrible quality. This class is dry as the Sahara. Homework is annoying and worth too few points. Seems like everyone failed this class........
She is very effective. Has handouts each week with fill in the blanks for notes that she goes through. Quizzes every week that can be tricky, but aren't terrible. No surprises on exams, study a bit for them and you will be fine. No homework other than practice problems to prepare for the quiz if you choose to do them. I would recommend taking her.
Is the worst stats professor at gvsu, take anyone else. She gives a quiz every week on material that's irrelevant to material taught. She treats everyone like children, lectures are god awful boring and don't help much.... Oh did your grandma die or did you get really sick well It doesn't matter because there are no make ups for test or quizzes.
Avoid this professor at all costs. She makes things over complicated and has unnecessary weekly quizzes. She will make this class more time consuming and stressful than your more important classes.
Treats you like a child. She isn't willing to help you with the simplest things. I absolutely hated this class. If you study you'll do fine, it's just a pain to sit through the lectures and quizzes every week.  Take anyone else if possible.
Do not take this class with her. She gives a quiz at the start of every class period regardless of material learned in the last class and exams are TOUGH. Like no review sheet, no even clues to what will be on your test. It's rough and you really have to do the homework she assigns/just leaves on blackboard and doesn't ever talk about. Good luck...
Good at explaining things and gives good examples, but treats everyone like they are little kids.
She teaches very well and uses good examples. Be ready for a 25 point quiz every other class period. Very picky when it comes to grading. Workload not much though.
Professor is knowledgeable and helpful - conveys information clearly and provides multiple handouts and examples to aid understanding. Workload is very manageable, and an A is definitely attainable if you're willing to put in the time.","Diann is a very tough grader.

439,"Greg is a great guy.  It looks like he's gotten bad reviews in the classroom, but if you take him for a class where you're actually playing music, he's an awesome prof.  I have Steel Drum Band with him, and it's one of the best parts of my week.  He's funny, helpful, and super chill.  Definitely take a playing class or private lesson with Greg!
He is extremely boring to listen to, but he understands that 99% of the students in his class are only here to fulfill gen ed's.  Therefore, he makes his class easy, we only had 3 tests and 3 assignments all semester.  Easy class, but boring to attend.
A drag to go to class everyday. So boring. The prof knows his stuff, but his class is just harder than it needs to be. Hard to follow, doesn't give any visuals and doesn't care about his students.
save yourself from the misery of him rambling on and on about nothing. He is completely monotone and does not interact with the class, no talking allowed and going to class is a huge waste of time and knowing that you had to PAY for this class to hear him incorrectly puts around on the piano is really discouraging. way to go gvsu.
Class was very boring. He covered stuff that we would never need to know. Talks an entire class period about nothing. Pretty much a waste of time. Goes over music too, but it isn't needed since you have to listen on your own anyways to learn the music. My advice, don't take this professor, I didn't learn very much from him.
He is very laid back and approachable.Funny and interesting. Knows his stuff.Class is simple, just study the notes.The listening list is easy for me to learn the night before a test,but that's not for everyone. That might be where you get into trouble. Just start going over it a good week or so before the test and you should be ok.simple material
Good class for music majors learning percussion techniques, always popular with the ladies, and very good percussionist. The Steel band rocked when I was there.
Well,he isnt hard at all.Hes pretty straight forward on whats on the tests,but if youre looking for a friendly prof who is welcoming...look other places.
Greg is a good prof. He trys to introduce students to new types of music and expand your horizons a little. He is very knowledgable and has a lot of experience in music. Also, he's funny and understanding. I would definatly take his class again.
Painfully boring class. He knows his stuff, but it seems like he expects that we already have a background in music. Listening list isn't too bad, probably the easiest part of the tests. Just one of those gen eds to et out of the way (why do I need to learn about music to teach deaf kids?)
Listening lists are 2-3 times as big as other profs, literally. If you KNOW music probably isn't hard, for rest of us its way too much work for a Gen ed, let alone a 100lvl gen ed. The ""easy"" stuff is knowing rhythem and ""Color"" or texture, give me a break!
Very Boring class if your not interested in music. Easy class even though the listining list are long. The concerts arnt to bad. He doesnt give much notes so it is kind of hard to study for the class. Good prof. overall even though he make class boring, you will sleep.
VERY dry sense of humor,needs to loosen up w/the class(maybe have a drink before).Never looks you in the eye.He knows his stuff and has interesting stories.Having a musical background really helps.25% of grade concert papers aren't even graded so just do them and learn listening lists.Kind of cute!
Very easy class.  Tests are easy.  Barely any homework... all you have to do is show up and listen to music.
If u are not a music major DONT TAKE THIS CLASS.. he gives too much reading for a gen ed. Listening list are to long..He cancel class often. Lazy Prof.
This guy is terribly boring, not to mention not very friendly. He also talks about his steel drum band constantly. But he's pretty easy and cancels a lot.
very easy professor. cancels class a lot. VERY dry sense of humour. listening tests are very easy if you study a little bit beforehand.
Not a very hard class, but he isn't the nicest person I've ever met. Cancels class quite a bit. The listening portion of the tests suck, make sure you start listening a few weeks in advance. Isn't that interesting of a teacher, he's just kind of....there.
he was pretty bad.  It's easy to do well, but he forgets that it's a gen ed.  he skips all over while talking and expects too much with the listening lists--hardest part of the tests by far.","This guy is terribly boring, not to mention not very friendly.

441,"I took career education with her. She helped me find my major and I am now going into HR management. This is a great, easy class that helps students figure out what they want to do in life based on their personalities and interests. Im glad that I took this class. Take this class if you arent sure about which major you want to declare.
I went to her as my pre-major advisor.  I ended up crying because I had no idea what I was doing.  She helped with my schedule, but told me to forget being a teacher because I wouldn't be able to get a job.  I'm going to be a high school teacher.  I guess her telling me I couldn't was what made me go for it.  Not exactly inspiring.
Career education class: it was SO easy, and very helpful if you are unclear about what to do. have to do an easy research paper and a quick presentation of the profession you chose. super easy.
TERRIBLE. I didn't have a major, and she talked me into taking upper-level classes as a freshman, saying I didn't want to close anymore doors for myself. She talked me into taking Bio120 when I was in no way interested in science, and I got a D in it. She also made my schedule more or less by herself - I could have done that, I wanted ADVICE.
she is a wonderful advisor :)
Great advisor! Always willing to listen and to help.
She's so nice and understanding!
very understanding...class can be boring though
very caring and intellegent",Great advisor! Always willing to listen and to help.
445,"He is my favorite professor at GVSU! He is nice and understanding. Homework is pretty light, and he is a fair grader. His classes are really interesting and you will learn a lot.
Really cares about students, super nice. I got to learn about interesting topics outside of my major. Amazing choice for an issues course. Super easy and Russel is the sweetest person ever.
Honestly this class was a super easy A, but there was really no point of going unless we were doing an activity in class, which he tells you beforehand. Most of the class was just him ranting about random stuff, sweet guy, but really unnecessary. Exams were online, so easy. Big grade is group project at end that isn't really explained well.
Is very unorganized and is hard to find assignments dude because he has so much stuff on his blackboard. Tough grader WOULD NOT TAKE
Dr. Rhoads is a very nice guy. He is so sweet and caring. His lecture style is participation based, it's best to take him at a time of day people are willing to talk (Not a Monday 6-9). Lectures at night are boring because no one is willing to participate, making the class not as interesting as it should be. I enjoyed taking him.
He is so caring and kind, but having him on a Monday 6-9 was not the best choice! He has a very monotone voice which makes this class hard to listen to because it is late at night. I wish this class was not a 6-9 because it would be so much more engaging. Your expectations are clear, his lectures are just confusing at times. It is an easy A!!
He's an okay dude, I'm taking his 6-9 Cultural Anthropology class and it's hell on earth. He is very passionate about what he teaches and it is kind of extreme, he's picky on what he wants in his assignments. He overly explains EVERYTHING. This class is interesting but not on a Monday night.
He is very nice. The class itself was very boring, and his teaching was very disorganized. If you want to actually learn about anthropology, dont take him. If you want an easy A, take him.
Great professor. I had this class as a hybrid and every week when assignments were due, he went above and beyond in giving explanations to why you got the grade you did. He has a real love for anthropology and it shows! 2 projects, one that was a group. Did not take too much time out of my scheudle
Professor Rhoads is probably one of the nicest professors that I have had at GVSU. His lectures do tend to get a little boring if you are not interested in what he has to say, however he will keep a smile on his face And continue. He genuinely cares about the students and is extremely understanding. His project instructions are sometimes vague.
I really enjoyed Prof. Rhoads's lectures when I went in. This was one of two courses I had this semester where I felt comfortable skipping, and I would only miss his personal stories from his fieldwork. He puts most of his lecture into powerpoints, and gives almost every handout in class. He's also a really nice guy, generally speaking.
Rhoads is a really nice guy. His lectures can be very boring at times, but the material in the course was interesting. We had two exams, the midterm and final, and both were online. Most of the grade is dependent on the final project, but he gives you all semester to work on it.
Great Professor! Anyone taking ANT 204 this is the professor you want! He is really nice and keeps the lectures interesting. He is a fair grader so you do not have to worry about your GPA in this course. I learned a lot from him and it was just a fun course overall. Online midterm that you do at home and take-home final exam essays.
Rhoads was an amazing professor that helped me easily get a Gen Ed course out of the way. There was no test involved just a final group project. He grades very fairly and you really just need to show up and listen to pass. Wish I could take his class again. Amazing.
I would take this class again but only because it fulfills two gen ed requirements. He is a nice guy but expectations were often unclear and he was extremely unorganized. My blackboard was always overflowing with irrelevant material that we never got to in class . Long lectures and he often runs out of time. Lots of group work but its an easy A.
There are a bunch of reading and discussion board assignments but no exams.  Most of your grade comes from a group project at the end but it's very easy and straightforward.  He's a fun professor and a very chill guy.
There are a lot of homework and reading assignments. They are easy and short and most of the time interesting. 40% of your points are the final project. Super caring professor and understanding of college students.
Russ knew what he was talking about and shared his experiences with you. He made things clear and there wasn't a lot of homework. Very understanding and helpful. Take him!
To be completely honest I'm a nursing student and was busy enough as it is and Professor Rhoads required a lot of work outside of the class (a massive group project that required you to go to events, a ridiculous amount of reading, etc.) His lectures didn't cover anything on the exams, he required lots of group work which I really didn't like.
Professor Rhoads is a great professor to take for this class! All his exams are online and he gives you study guides for each of them. One group project that you are able to gradually work on over the course of the semester. If you do the homework, turn things in on time, and put in effort, you'll get an A.","He is so caring and kind, but having him on a Monday 6-9 was not the best choice!

446,"Very lecture heavy class. Go to class to get the information because many answers to weekly objective questions are not on the slides. Several extra credit opportunities. Have to go on a 3 hour cruise, read a book that you take 2 quizzes on in class, and do a creative project on the book. If you put in good effort you will do fine.
Peter was a great Prof probably my favorite one this semester. He is funny and has occasional goofy moments in class. I thought the class was easy, but only if you put in the time and do the work. Do the readings, read the book, do the weekly questions, etc. If you do the work you will be fine.  
He's not a bad person just not the best teacher. I was able to save my grade with the extra credit. most people were doing so poorly that he gave out a ton of EC opportunities near the end of the semester. Go to class and read the articles you'll be ok. Quizzes are on BB timed at 20 minutes but you're not in lock down browser.
I loved him!! The class was pretty straight forward, just watch all the lectures and you'll be fine. But, the questions on the tests and quizzes are very specific to the lectures, you must watch them. Quizzes every week and three exams.
Peter is a good professor, and he is really knowledgeable of the subjects he taught. He may seem a little weird at first, but turns out to be a cool guy. He offers extra credit during the semester which is always a plus. We read a book throughout the semester and he split the book into two quizzes which were easy if you read the material.
He's alright to me honestly. He's very keen on just using pictures and a few words for his slides during lectures, which isn't very helpful when using them to study for his exams. He does come off as a bit weird but he's really a nice professor and knows what he's doing but I would not take this class again because I fall asleep in class sometimes
He might seem a little weird but he's very interested in what he does and makes it more enjoyable for everyone. He takes his 112 class on a 4 day field trip to Missouri which was super fun. He can be a little boring at times during lecture but it's not too bad. Probably could get away without getting the text book
Peter is a legend! Greatest professor here at GV by far, wish I could give him a higher ranking than a 5. He makes classes super fun, he might seem weird at first but give him and chance and you'll find him hilarious
Taking this as a gen ed, but I'm actually really interested. Peter is hilarious and his tests really aren't difficult if you study. GO TO LECTUREpay attention and you'll be fine. He gives great feedback as well; he emailed me congratulating me on an A for the first exam. A few pointless group activities, but they're easy points. Take this class!
i only took geology as a gen ed to dodge chemistry. but he made it SO SO SO much fun...it was hands on and easy. easier than a high school course. learn a lot and lots of opportunities for extra credit. take him or else take chemistry....
Hes a really nice funny guy. his tests are kinda tricky some times but i have recieved over 40 points of extra credit so far. i suggest taking this prof if u take geo.
Awesome prof! his lectures are boring, but he has a very unorthodox sense of humor. He's rather funny and it's an overall fun class. Get to know him out of class. Hilarious! also gives EXTRA CREDIT out of this world
Prog Reimersma was a great guy. He knows and LOVES what he is talking about. I really have to interest in geology but he made it fun. Test van be a challenge. I am a straight A student andgot B's on the tests but got an A in the class. He offers lots of extra credit. Attendance not madatory but he has pop assignments which help raise grades so go!
Peter is a funny guy. He's entertaining to talk to outside of class. But his lectures are dry and boring.  His tests are not overly easy. There are easy, mildly fun in class assignments for points on random days. He doesn't give many homework assignments, but the ones he does give are time consuming. He gives Extra Credit out like nobody's business
Awesome profesor! Absolutly hilarious! Exams are a little tough. Sometimes a little hard to pay attention in class because it can be boring. Read the articles online for the 3 or 4 quizzes he may give you. Overall really funny guy.
BEEEST TEACHER EVER! so awesome. love his sweaters. make sure you make friends with him in discussion, you'll love every minute you talk with him. TAKE HIM!
LOVED HIM! BEST PROF EVERRR! made me want to be a geology teacher. hilarious! go on the gypsum mine trip. good times. ride with him in his car there too, you'll really get to know him. go to class every day, its not a must but it helps and there's surprise in class homeworks. loved his sweaters. labs were fun. really awesome teacher
This is my favorite professor by far. He made a class that could easily put me to sleep interesting. If you pay attention in class, you will pass, and he slips in so much humor. He posted review questions before the exams, so if you reviewed these the night before, you could ace the exam. I highly recomend him. He cares alot. very helpful.
Funny man, yet for geo100 you will be bored completely and he makes you do a group presentation that is a waste of time and dependent on other group members. Overall an easy class but irritating.
Funny guy. Willing to help. Tests are challenging so study, read, and take good notes. Angus cruise field trip wasn't the greatest but still entertaining. Can be a tough grader. Interesting class.","Funny guy. Willing to help. Tests are challenging so study, read, and take good notes. Angus cruise field trip wasn't the greatest but still entertaining. Can be a tough grader. Interesting class."
449,"There are no clear guidelines in the class. I didn't have a grade in blackboard until AFTER finals week, so if you enjoy knowing where you stand in a class, don't take him. 
If you don't like Yatin or don't think he's interesting you probably shouldn't be a finance major. Definitely one of the smartest guys I've had as a prof. I had him for FIN 428, 438, and 422. Very smart and also funny in a nerdy kind of way. He's also done the CFA make sure to ask him about that if you're pursing that post grad.
This class is very tough. The grading is made up of three exams, three case write-ups, class participation, final exam, term paper, and in-class quizzes. Yatin is very knowledgeable in finance and the class is very lecture-heavy. Although the class is pretty difficult, he did provide our class with extra credit points one day during class.
This class was basically an independent study with changing requirements each time you have class, unclear expectations, surprise reports, and no lecture. He just rambles on and doesn't actually teach about how to invest. Class was 1.5 cr with the work of a 3 cr+ class. Expects you to know ALL finance topics regardless of your class standing.
Avoid this Professor at all costs! He grades hard with extremely vague directions. Very exam heavy. Rarely responds to emails and when he does they are often very short and not helpful. He had zero idea how to use technology. Never posted a single grade the whole semester. He would also yell at students for not understanding the material.
Yatin is very unclear on what is expected and you will be lost. You will not know what is going on. You will not be graded on anything. You will most likely not learn anything. This is coming from someone with a 3.7 GPA and cares about learning and tries in school. I expected more from my finance capstone.
NEVER in my undergrad have I withdrawn from a class until I took Bhagwat. Very little clear communication, support, and ability to clarify content in class. NOBODY knew what was going on (even the finance majors), and does not do well at all to test and prepare you for exams. Picky grader, passing is >69%, and very heavy final (1/3 of grade).
There was very little communication with students, and virtually none after an abrupt switch to completely online class. He stopped posting online lectures about halfway through the semester, and if you missed an in-person lecture it was very difficult to figure out what content was actually covered. Save yourself the frustration if class is remote
Not a fan of how this professor handled online classes this semester. He was very unclear about what he was looking for and was difficult to communicate with. I expected more from my capstone professor.
Prepare for no feedback on anything you turn in. He is completely technologically illiterate. By the end of this semester he had not updated a single grade and the entire class was left in the dark on what their grade was until final grades were due in banner. He will call on everyone during class and harass you if you do not know the answer
Do not take Yatin for any class. Covid showed that he is actually Blackboard illiterate, and he is incapable of using anything besides email. Unclear expectations on assignments followed by difficult grading. Hands down the worst professor I've ever had in my 17 years of education.
So disorganized. You never have any idea what is happening in the class. It also seems like he is blackboard illiterate, his class page is always a scavenger hunt for what you are looking for. Useless syllabus. You won't have any idea what your grade is until you get it at the end. If you have anxiety, stay away from this prof!!
His instructions are very, VERY hard to understand. I took this class online and basically had to figure everything out for myself. The assignments are very tedious and require you to work for the grade you want. The quizzes all require you to show work as well.(Ex. one homework assignment took two full days to complete) Don't slack and you'll pass
Yatin is actually a really funny guy and extremely intelligent. However, he needs to realize he teaches at Grand Valley and not Harvard. This class is extremely difficult. Tests are made up of 8-10 questions and account for most of your grade. Heavily based on your ability to do algebra rather than financial equations. Great guy, terrible teacher.
Don't take him!! His lectures are hard to follow and he gets into some really technical finance theorems without any introduction. His tests are only 8-10 questions a piece and he isn't clear on what topics will appear. The textbook isn't much help either, since his test are usually over what he says in his lectures.
Prof. Bhagwat is one of the best profs I've had at GV. He is very difficult and expects a lot, but is one of few profs that can do that and effectively make you learn the material. Lecture only, not a ton of homework. Exams and quizzes are tough, but if you practice you will be fine. You wont make it if you dont want to work hard.
I very much regret taking this professor. The textbook he uses isn't helpful, especially when it comes to equations. There doesn't seem to be any calculation method for how he grades exams, as he just tags off points without any explanation for why he took that amount of points. Class time isn't used effectively, and he is just a sour person.
The only guy GV has to teach 429. Overall he was a nice enough guy, but the class really didn't know what he was looking for. His grading was inconsistent and you will go the entire semester without knowing your grade. You have to go to class for the material or you might as well just drop the class and find something else. Master the formulas.
He is the only professor that teaches international finance, so you don't have much of a choice. Just make sure you do not miss class because this is challenging!!
Professor was often disorganized and at times did not always directly answer students questions. Grading on test did not really make sense and handwriting was often difficult to read. I felt lost throughout most of the class.",Avoid this Professor at all costs! He grades hard with extremely vague directions. Very exam heavy.

450,"Professor Norwood is really awesome, funny and smart. Class is super easy and take home exams. I like to take his class again, one of my favorite Professor at COC. Thanks
I took the Business 160 class and Im just want to say Professor Norwood is an exceptional Professor with skills of which he obtains to unlock parts of my brain that I never had used before. He will go down in history as one of my most favorite professors I have ever had. I would not be writing this comment if it was not true.
a lot of notes and a lot of reading. i like how he makes sure we read the book because we talk about it and he randomly picks on people
Amazing
Tom - was a huge inspiration even 11 years past graduation I talk about him a lot.
TOM IS AWESOME.  If there is one prof. to ever have teach you at GVSU, let it be him.  Down to Earth, entertaining, outgoing and passionate about keeping his students interested.  I loved him.
I really enjoyed this class, its was interesting and fun, and prof wolterink always relates the material to real like situations, this proves to be very helpful during the exams. loved this class and this professor!!!
I was really looking forward to taking this class, but he is 1 of the worst profs I've had so far @ GV...doesn't even teach..just talks about random crap and has students teach the class,then breezes thru chapters & tells you certain key terms to know. Very confusing & impossible to follow - take someone else's class if you want to actually learn.
ONE OF THE BEST PROFS EVER. Enjoy Retirement Tom, God Bless.
Great guy.  Makes class fun and tries to entertain.  Doesn't scare anyone away from business careers.  Extra credits let students teach students.  Always willing to talk to you about anything.   He can relate to college students.  I would have him again.
Tom is a great guy and is always looking for ways for you to get a good grade.  Tests were kind of hard, but if you go to the review he will give you some of the answers. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT for an easy A!
one of the nicest people I know. Really takes an interest in his students and makes class fun. Test or worded funny sometimes but offers a lot of extra credit and is pretty easy to get an A
Great Prof!!! Really easy, do the extra credits and you will get an A, always show up for the review because he gives some answers and tells what will be on the test
Easy class! Do extra credit and you will get an A. Grade point booster if you need it.
I like Tom as a person; he's a great guy.  However, I did not learn as much in this class as I would have liked to.  He explains things by telling personal stories, which is entertaining but not helpful.  His tests are completely invalid, as they dont measure what youve learned.  True, you can do the EC but spending $ on this class isnt recommended
Wolterink is THE MAN. AWESOME prof. Makes class very interesting. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT.
Tom is a great guy! Very fun! However, the tests are somewhat difficult and you dont really learn any textbook material during the class periods. The class is more about memorizing definitions and ideas than it is about actually learning. If you do an extra credit then you still will get a good grade.
this might have been the easiest class i've ever taken...tests were hard b/c i didnt study, but he gives so much extra credit, i still got an A!
Tom is the best!His class is a little random, but what you take away from his class is his own experiences with business.He's 'been there and done that'.Really helpful with everything from advice to the actual class. Tests are straight from book, but the extra credit is what saves ya! Go to every class because he's big on xtra credit 'jsut because'
Great prof. Gives you lots of chances to raise your grade in class. Knows the material and is more than willing to talk to you about it and give advice for the future. Tests are straight forward. If you are confused about what area of business to go into this is the class for you.",Great guy.  Makes class fun and tries to entertain.  Doesn't scare anyone away from business careers.  Extra credits let students teach students.  Always willing to talk to you about anything.   He can relate to college students.  I would have him again.
451,"Class is basically graded by your two exams. Quiz's you are timed and most of the stuff doesn't relate to the test. What he says in class really doesn't matter. Test study guides you can basically not even look at, not helpful at all. His lectures are as boring as talking to your grandma. 
Easy to pass this class- do your work and you will pass. Attendance isn't mandatory. Graded only by quizzes, 4 HW assignments, final exam, final project. Can take this class all online b/c he posts all lectures and homework online. 
The lectures are pretty boring to listen to, and he writes everything out on the board so there isn't much stimulation either. If you like teachers that just speak and write on the board though, this guy actually is great for you.
The class is divided up with 4 homework assignments, quizzes and a project and final. Not a lot of work, so a solid choice if you work and do school. Has a cool accent, and has realistic homework due dates. I would take him again.
Watch for the quiz deadlines or you're screwed. I missed the first two and he didn't budge. Textbook is through Pearson, which is over $100 but there are quizlets everywhere on the internet for the quizzes and exams. No lockdown browser. Good prof and cares for his students otherwise. Intelligent and cool UK accent
Great prof! His accent (from England) makes everything better because he is hilarious and makes class fun. 10/10 would take him again. He's a super easy teacher, just do the homework and study for tests and you'll pass.
Although I have hated the subject of economics in the past, Professor Simons made it seem enjoyable. All the notes for the exam come from the lectures, but he makes the lectures easy to understand and follow. He is one of my favorite professors at GV!
Im an Alumni. Still 9 years later I continue to recommend Professor Simons to current GV students (interns at my work). ECO 369 is a must take class. Please do yourself a favor and take this class. Thank you!
Prof. Simons was a really good professor. For an online class, it was pretty easy, 12 quizzes (2 per week) and 2 mini quizzes for the final. Overall, reading the chapter was the only homework other than the quizzes. I would take him again!
This class was kind of difficult. Your grade is determined pretty much off the midterm and final and a few other homework's. You have one small presentation by yourself that is about 1-2 minutes so not terrible. Does random in class participation so showing up would be beneficial. He is very strict on rules. Idk not my fav
Excellent professor. Always available via email for help in this hybrid style course. Grades hard on homework, but is more lenient on exams. He is a great lecturer, provides useful tools and videos for reference and is very honest/funny during class. You wont regret you took this class because you learn the materials well. Beware of final project.
Simons is an awesome guy, and I really enjoyed this class. He is very effective at teaching and somehow makes economics quite interesting to learn about. Whatever is written on the board is guaranteed to be on the exam, so take good notes. I'd take him again and I would encourage anyone to take him. He's easy-going and likes to swear. Recommended.
Very funny professor. The class was very interesting and worth taking. The professor was effective at teaching the material and I felt I learned a lot. Overall I would highly recommend this professor to anyone taking an economics class that he teaches.
Awesome prof. Would take him for every class if I could. Inspired me to change my major to Econ. Exams and quizzes are exactly like the study guide and review packets he posts. Study those and take good notes in class. He has a funny brit accent too.
I chose prof. simons because he had good reviews on here, sadly I was mistaken. I crashed and burned in his course. He only grades on the three exams and a few quizzes, no homework so points are limited. I am retaking the course with a new prof now and we are learning completely different things so really idk what I was even learning with simons
I enjoyed Professor Simons. Very kind guy who knows his stuff. Three exams and a final that is non-cumulative. If you show up to class and take good notes you should excel in this course.
So.. if you are someone like me who has test anxiety, do not take him. The class is 3 exams, 3 or 4 quizzes and one assignment. He was a great prof but his lecture style did not work for me and i struggled in this course. I went to almost every class (missed 1) and read the book and barely managed to get a C. if you are not like me, i recommend him
I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures, he's hilarious!  He does his best to make a very dry topic interesting and relevant, which was easy this year given the election in Nov.  Come to class, read the material he posts, take good notes (if he writes, you'd better write it too), and you'll be fine.  Always willing to answer questions and clarify.
Professor Simons is a wonderful professor, and I appreciate his competence as a professor. He teaches visually, using the whiteboards to illustrate his examples rather than sticking to a powerpoint. He is always willing to clarify and or reexamine examples he made. Assignments are two projects at the start and end of semester and three exams.
Only reason to get the textbook is to do the homework. If you go to class MOST of the time you can get an easy A without reading any of the chapters. He does do pop ""quizzes"" if he notices a lot of people didn't show up that day. The 50 minute classes are bearable and sometimes he shows videomovie clips. Great guy.","Excellent professor.

453,"I feel like his quizzes and tests are made to trick you. There are two parts to his tests . There is a multiple choice section and essay portion. The essay portion questions are not very clear. If it wasn't for extra credit on the quizzes I probably wouldn't have passed. He rarely replies to emails!
He rambles..... a lot..... not even related to the material. Read the book carefully because he draws questions from things that are mentioned once in the text. You don't really need to study his slides or show up really if you read the book carefully.
I don't usually leave these things but I feel like I have to with him. For me, and I'm assuming others as well, I cannot do well on a test that is over 120 pages, with no specifics on what to study for. He asked such specific questions and it was difficult to pay attention in class as he went off on tangents all the time.
Fitzgerald is slightly awkward but humorous sometimes. To be successful in this class it Is a MUST that you come to every lecture, take detailed notes, and READ THE BOOK I repeat you really need to read the book lol if you do that you should be fine. Fitzgerald isn't a lot of help but there is much help available from TA's and tutoring!
All he dose is talk. You will understand what he is saying, then he talks about the same thing for another 30 minutes. Avoid this class at all costs 
Super boring professor, lectures are long and he goes off topic all the time. Almost never knows how to work anything to do with technology and never replies to emails. Makes mistakes on tests a lot
Fitz is a classic. He has been in the psych field since the 60s. It was a real privilege to have the opportunity to study with a person who has such an extensive breadth of experience. He teaches to the deep endhigh IQ end of the pool. So if you aren't looking to learn, look elsewhere ... 
Very bad, I do not recommend taking the course with this guy. a lot of work on online assignments, his lecture is useless since you need to study from the book. and the book has way more information than he lecture about.
One of the easy class that Wayne offers, all you must do it study the book forget about the lecture and study the book also take advantage of the extra credit.
To be honest, this class is very easy. Most people who complain about this class never show up until it's time to take the test. Not showing up for lectures= not having a clue about what's on the test, and what to study for. He pretty much goes over in his PPT slides what will be on the test( have to attend lectures to know that, or ask someone).
Where do I begin... Fitzgerald is a bland professor. He is very boring, however, his class is very passable. I received an avg grade of 50% on the exams, and I have a B+ in the class. The online homework is simple, and the TAs are great. Kelsey was an excellent TA.If you don't want to go to lecture and do little work,take this class.
Professor Fitzgerald is very rude and quite frankly needs to retire. He emailed his students multiple times complaining about us because we had too many questions for him. He messed up our grades on multiple occasions and got upset when we brought it to our attention. Never recommending him to anyone. EVER.
Don't take this class if you don't want to invest time reading the book.  He's not great as a teacher, but you can boost your grade with extra credit and homework assignments online.  Labs were ridiculously easy. Tests can be difficult if you didn't study his slides and if you didn't study out of the book.
Starting off the semester I was really excited about having a psychology class. However, Fitzgerald turned that excitement into loathing. Do not take this class with him. Exams were ridiculously hard since you never knew what to study and his lectures with the most boring thing. Always went off on different, irrelevant topics.
He goes off topic a lot in class, and hardly anything he goes over in class is on the test.  He can be very boring, and his tests always have errors in them, as if he doesn't check them. I suggest reading the book if you're gonna have him.  The one good thing about his is he gives out a lot of extra credit.
His class really discouraged my enjoyment of psychology. His lecture is very monotonous and boring. His homework scheduling is terrible & confusing. And worst of all, he isn't considerate of any of his students. My suggestion... Don't take him.
No No No.
Very boring class. He goes off topic way too much and his exams have hardly anything to do with the slides you have to go over. Need to study the book and anything he says isn't as important is most likely on the exam. Passed with a B though but it was on the homework and lab mainly.
He goes off topic way to much. I dont even go to the lecture because its not even useful. My book is online so is the quiz so i did everything myself.  Hes too slow and behind on the lecture.
I'm surprised I'm the only one rating him from my class since everyone seemed to hate him so much. He is a great prof, seriously. He gets off topic, sure. But it does help you understand the big picture. Just read the book and attend class and you'll get an A. If you don't get an A, it's cause you are straight up lazy. 3 tests, 1 paper, that's it.",Professor Fitzgerald is very rude and quite frankly needs to retire.

456,"I liked him as a person but his grading was unbelievably hard. I agree with the other comments about him not letting people have other opinions. For papers I would do everything his comments and corrections said but still wouldnt get the grade I was expecting.
I do like Dr. Katz as a person and enjoyed talking to him at advising meetings but I do NOT agree with the way he grades. He told me I had excellent peer editing yet refused to give me a 100 on any of them. He also gave me lower grades on papers even when I took corrections and went to the writing center. His class is unnecessarily difficult.
Whatever you do, avoid this professor like the plague. This class was an absolute waste of my time and one of the most stressful college courses I have ever taken. He grades without clear reasoning as to why he is giving you that score and absolutely refuses to give 100s or even 99s even if he doesn't have anything you can improve on. Please avoid
Professor Katz is a hard-working guy that also wants you to be a hard worker. His class isn't easy and he will really want you to participate and work hard. In the end, you'll become a much better writer. He's also nice to talk to and always has interesting things to say
He doesnt talk about anything you need to know. Very boring professor. Would not recommend taking him.
Katz is a really great guy, he is funny and loves sharing stories about his kids in class. However, Katz is also insanely hard as far as grading goes. He expects perfection, and participation in class. This is my favorite class even though i am making a C- in it simply because he makes the topics so interesting. Take this class if you want to learn
Avoid him like the plague!
Sets high standards. Actively engages the class and is genuinely interested in what you think.  Will improve your writing ability. One of my favorite professors, highly recommended.
He definitely makes you think, he asks for your ideas and then draws upon them further...definitely likes participation and likes new ideas.  He's really upfront, blunt, and loud.  May not be best for quiet people and slackers...he really sets high standards for papers.
Professor Katz is very insightful.  He draws us into discussions on topics that affect each and every one of us and emplores us to find depth in everything we do.  Really intelligent and down to earth.  He doesn't take kindly to slackers though.
Always condescending to anyone who disagrees with him. Grades are based on how much butt you kiss. In his words, if you didn't agree with him then your thoughts and logic weren't properly ""developed"". Those who agreed with his opinions passed and all others failed. Took same D papers from his class and got A's with a different professor. Ridiculous
Without question, the highlight of the UNCA lit department. Ed Katz is forthright, engaging, intellectually challenging, and never condescending. Also, funny as hell and lacking all pretension. If you opt to take one of his upper level classes, he will make you work for it, but it's worth it.
Katz gave a speech at the June 14 Freshman orientation. It was totally pointless and his stupid sports metaphors were lost on most of us! Also, he needs to stop saying ""y'all"". His lame attempt at being ""Southernized"" made him sound ev
Dr. Katz is like the Emeril of HUM... exciting, volatile, VERY knowledgable, with a funky sense of humor. His class is hard, but worth it from how smart you feel afterwards.
Good teacher, fun class.  Too much research.
very hard classes, but makes you think.  highly recomended to those who would like a challenge","Professor Katz is a hard-working guy that also wants you to be a hard worker.

457,"Although his class was lecture heavy, he thoroughly explained how to do the math. It was exactly what I needed because I struggle with math. He always accepted questions and made the lectures fun and interesting. He is a kind and caring Professor. I recommend this class to anyone needing to take Research Methods 1. 
An amazing professor that uses interesting real data to help communicate math and statistics. Very good at reading a class and creates a safe environment. 
Exams are hard but hes very lenient and willing to work with you. He wants you to know how to do the math but barely penalizes you if you get the wrong answer. You will know material of exams. 
Dr. Harvey is a delight in the classroom and is very playful and understanding towards his students. He doesn't expect you to know any levels of math outside of basic middle school division and multiplication. He doesn't rely on slides, so if you miss a class, you'll miss out on some important info unless you study notes from a classmate.
Dr. Harvey is very accommodating. He makes sure to push his students in a positive direction without us feeling bogged down. Sometimes I email him on weekends asking questions and he always responds in a timely manner. Math is a weakness of mine but he puts in effort to make me feel seen and heard with questions. 12/10 would recommend him. 
Harvey will help you understand any information necessary. Show up for his lectures, they are very fun, but don't worry if you miss a class, he takes a picture of ALL notes for the day. Very communication friendly
I cannot give Harvey enough praise. I loved him! I had him right when we all switched to online during the middle of the pandemic and bless his heart he was working so hard to accommodate us. I loved him and am sad I am graduating and will not have a class of his again. He took a boring statistics class and made it amazing.
Dr. Harvey is easily one of the top 5 teachers in my entire academic career. Funny, respectful toward his students, and understanding. He's just a cool guy that wants to help you pass his class. We had 4 tests (12 multiple choice - 2 math) and one two page paper. Completely manageable. If you show up and participate you'll do well.
I'm going to miss watching him pace the room for over an hour lol. He is a very animated talker and loves it when the class participates. I dreaded this class but it isn't actually math heavy and prof Harvey makes it interesting. He is always willing to answer any questions and seems to genuinely care. 10/10 would recommend.
Dr. Harvey is super funny and always makes class interesting. Go to class take notes and ask questions and you'll do pretty good on his 3 exams. For the Labs/essays ask questions he always answers and don't procrastinate.
He is a very engaging teacher. If you take notes in class then you have everything you need to study for the 3 exams. He also gives thorough study guides for each exam. No textbooks and minimal reading assignments.
He is a hard teacher, but he is very nice and willing to work with students.
I loved Dr Harvey. He is very organized and a clear teacher. Very easy to meet up with outside of class, and encourages students to contact him with any questions. That being said, I found his tests to be hard and the research proposal was long and extensive. Even though the work was tough, hes a really nice guy and a great teacher.
Dr. Harvey was hilarious in class! I took his 8 a.m. class and he made most of my mornings really enjoyable. Even though most of the time I almost fell asleep (because I am not a morning person), he always finds a way to make the stuff we are learning more fun.
Dr. Harvey was the *first* person that made stats click with me, and thats after STAT185 and RMI. His instruction leaves for zero grey area/confusion, as he if very thorough and makes sure 100% of his classroom is understanding everything. This means that if you have a question, don't be afraid to pipe up! He's wonderful professor, TAKE HIS CLASS!!
Best math teacher I have ever had BY FAR (even though the class is research methods). Really knows how to help his students understand stats concepts. The class isn't difficult, but he doesn't just spoon feed you either. I loved the class and looked forward to it (even at 8:15am!) The best teacher I've had at UNCA so far. 
Really wonderful, funny, and eccentric guy. Clear and helpful with all his assignments and expectations. Would absolutely take him again!
A very enjoyable teacher to have. Really funny and engaging. Research Methods 2 is a pretty dull subject, but he brought a lot of spice to the subject; used a lot of relevant yet funny analogies, explained everything clearly, went over everything multiple times. I didn't buy the book. I took the 8am and it wasn't a hard class to stay awake in.
One of the best teachers I've ever had. He's super organized, clear, and very good at explaining the purpose of learning what we learn in class and how it relates to the bigger picture
Harvey is a great guy. He always offered help to those that needed it. I should have taken up that offer, haha. 
Harvey was a good professor, very helpful outside of class. I had the flu and was out for a week and he worked with me individually to make up work. you have to come to class because you do a lot of labs that you must be there to gather the info. I have to say that near the end of class he began to make semi per*erted and obscene jokes.","One of the best teachers I've ever had. He's super organized, clear, and very good at explaining the purpose of learning what we learn in class and how it relates to the bigger picture"
458,"Dr. Browning is extremely intelligent and knows a lot about his topic. The problem is, at 80 years old he really needs to retire. He knows so much that he often over complicates explanations and goes way off topic. He is also fairly opinionated. Environmental Eoncomics has been a struggle to get through and I don't recommend it.
One of the worst professors I have ever had. He is so boring I wanted to shoot myself after 30min. He gets off topic and never comes back on. DONT TAKE HIM PLZ
Dr. Browning is very nice and quirky. He is rather old and has trouble hearing and can be quite frustrating in class when everyone is shouting the right answer and then he looks around blankly and says the right answer as if no one knew... other than that his class was easy and had interesting course material. Learned a lot.
Great Professor. Makes the class interesting and relates topics to the real world. Just make sure to do the weekly reports.
Dr. Browning easily became one of my favorite professors of the semester. His ""What's For Dinner?"" class offers relevant and thought-provoking information. Expect to make a good grade in this class as long as you read the assigned texts and show up to class. He may be older than most professors, but that doesn't mean that he's senile.
Dr. Browning is such a sweet person! The class itself wasn't easy & he does ask you to read a lot, but the class discussions were pretty good.  He would get a on a rant though, and when he got going, that could be a little boring.  Overall, a really nice person & helpful when needed.
Dr. Browning is one of the sweetest professors I've had. Even though he is boring and long winded during class, he seems to enjoy meeting with students, whether it's to talk about the class or just life. Be prepared to work though, it's not an easy ride.
Tough teacher. Makes you write a report every week, and grades fairly tough.
he has the ability to make the class outstanding, and interesting.  but he kills all discusion as soon as he opens his mouth.  he is borring, and slow and i felt like my time was wasted.
Shirley Browning is an excellent Professor.  He encourages students to think about and become involved in important contemporary issues.  Within the classroom, Browning is engaging, often wry, and always respectful toward conscientious students.  This Prof. represents the best in Liberal Arts teaching.
Why didn't someone tell me how utterly boring this prof would be?Honestly, it's not overstating it saying that by attending class for that 1hr & 20+ mins,I lose my will to live.Life loses all color and becomes a tangle of graph lines and more graph lines.It's midway thru the semester and he's still setting up for the main topic. Very few grades!
We have to write a report every week, analyzing a article from the things we learn in class.  Is kind of hard
Very frustrating prof; not receptive to student ideas, very defensive; does not have set schedule for class readings making it very difficult to plan ahead; gets off topic; class moves very slowly
Good teacher you have to liston in class if you want to pass. teaches material that is not covered in most classes till intermediate but it helps in the long run I would take him again.
I really liked this guy.  He reminds me of my grandfather.  The text he uses is easy to understand.
great teacher...easy classes
Stubborn.  Won't listen to student's comments.  A sleeper teacher.","he has the ability to make the class outstanding, and interesting.  but he kills all discusion as soon as he opens his mouth.  he is borring, and slow and i felt like my time was wasted."
462,"what a joke. she treats us like we are 12. doesnt seem to know much about the subject either. if you ask her a question, she gets unsure and frazzled easily. not too sharp on her feet.
Gorgeous woman and superb professor. Knows her stuff and presents it fairly and concisely.
no comment
Totally HOT...too bad she's married!
Great teacher!!
Text was boring as was class. Tests are ok if you use the study guide.
She makes herself very available for students. Not too hard if you know material
Very nice teacher, knows what she's talking about, lectures can be boring
Lecture is difficult because of a lack of class participation; wonderful course
Excellent! Very caring, remembers students
She was a good. The class was very easy.
Great professor; lectures interesting and exams easy if you know the material.
Excellent professor, very personable and approachable.  Knows her stuff","Excellent professor, very personable and approachable.  Knows her stuff"
464,"Your grade is based on 3 exams, attendance, and daily homework assignments which are two pages summarizing the reading due every class. The tests are 3 pages of fill in the blank words - complete memorization. Pretty easy for a 400 level Econ class. The lectures are boring and unnecessary but go for the attendance credit since it counts.
Professor Seidman's honors section of ECON435 was a really manageable honors capstone. There was a lot of reading and summaries of the readings for every class, but the only honors addition was a 5-page research paper on a topic you choose. He gives feedback on the paper and boosts your grade for taking his suggestions. Exams are easy!
Professor Seidman is one of my favorite econ professors. The class had a lot of reading and 2-page summaries due each class, but you get used to it and it ends up not being too bad. He always gives past exams to study from and copies 80% of them on his new exams, so as long as you study the past ones, you'll be fine!
Every class you will have a two page homework assignment which isn't that bad really just tedious. Two exams and a final but he gives you the exams from the semester before and a lot of the information can be memorized. Show up, just sit there and you can get a decent grade with not too much effort.
Homework due every class, not difficult just frustrating.
Class is mandatory, but you won't learn anything, the exams are very close to the practice tests, and can be passed by pure memorization. If class was not mandatory I would not have gone since we were lectured at for over an hour twice a week for a full semester mostly about his theories and ideas. It's easy to get a good grade, but it's tedious.
Everything we learn in this class is his opinion so it makes taking tests memorizing what he says rather than learning anything. He assigns readings and a 2 page paper for every class but if you fill 2 pages your good. Easy class but just awful lectures.
Fairly easy class for a 400 level b/c he cares about his students, what they learn, what grade they get. 3 packets of articles, $60 each which sucks b/c you don't really need them as long as you know someone in class who has them. HW every class that is just summaries he checks for completion, 3 exams that are all memorization. Very relevant class
Seidman is a very passionate professor who cares about his students' success. There is a HW assignment due before each class but it truly reinforces the topics and prepares you for exams. He provides his last semester exams with his answers to the questions and your exams will be nearly identical to the last semester's. Great econ elective!!!
Seidman is great. Nice guy. Really knows his stuff. But lectures are so boring! I almost fell asleep at 9 am everytime. My fondest memory is when he sang the class the Beatles song, ""Taxman"". May have been one of the greatest moments of my undergrad career. Use the old test as a guide, do the homework and you're good. Test are just really long.
Best Econ professior I've ever hadHe cares about his studentsGo to office hours if you don't understand the material. He is so nice and friendly. Review the old examsread the textbookthe article on sakaiand the handout he gives then you'll be fine. I got a B only because english is my second language
Good dude. You have to read and do a homework assignment for every class, but it helps you understand the material. Exams are largely based off of the previous semester's correlating exam. Tests contain a lot of material, but they're easy to do well on if you put the time in. Lectures can get very dry, but he really does care about his students.
I took this class for an upper level breadth requirement. Be prepared to read 60-80 page articles and write a 2 page paper for every class. A lot of memorization and very close reading of dull material. He tries to be funny and he's a nice guy but the class isn't all that great unless you're really into the subject matter.
Seidman is the man. Really knows his stuff and had a passion for it. Wrote the textbook and only charges $30 for it. Gotta respect his quirkiness. Takes attendance and has homework due every class but it really helps for the tests which are mostly short answer. You will know what to expect though. Highly recommend
Easily the best Econ teacher I have had at UD. He makes funny jokes throughout class and enjoys teaching. His tests are very similar to the practice tests, he does pass an attendence sheet around so you should go to class. there are homework assignments every class, but are very simple and checked for completeness. overall great guy!
Seidman is probably one of the best professors I've had as an Econ major, despite the fact he's pretty liberal. The homeworks definitely help as do office hours. He actually cares about his students, can't say that about many others. He gives you old exams too. He actually sang ""The Taxman"" once in class, kind of funny.
Seidman is a decent economist but a pretty bummy teacher. Class drolls on and you don't actually learn anything about economics. If test questions aren't answered the way his theory anticipates they'd be answered then your answer is wrong.
Seidman is very intelligent, but also a bit of a know it all.  If you pay attention, you will learn a TON about macroeconomics.  Homework forces you to learn the material, but really do it.  Most studying should be done by looking at and practicing with old exams, but you want to have done the reading so you have the background knowledge.
Very nice guy, tries to be funny  and on occasion he's successful.   Good teacher, typical Keynesian though.
Definitely take him. Study last year's test and the homeworks and you'll be fine. He's a nice guy and his tests are fair. You have to sign in every class because attendance counts, but class is pretty much pointless. The good thing is he won't call on someone who doesn't raise their hand and you can do the homeworks during class.","Very nice guy, tries to be funny  and on occasion he's successful.

466,"The material taught in the class is a complete joke in itself, but Prange made the class interesting. If you were ever confused about anything, she would go over it with the class or individually in office hours. She has an odd sense of humor, is easily bothered, and is a bit eccentric, but those qualities made the class fun!
I loved prange! At first you will think she's crazy but then you will love her. I seriously wish she was my grandma she is hilar. she gives ALOT of online homework but it helps you in the end because you'll know how to do the problems. There are plenty of old tests to study from. I usually hate math but I actually loved her class. TAKE HER!!!
She is a good teacher. She explains problems to the best of her ability but it will be naturally difficult if you aren't good at math. She's so sweet and cracks stupid but funny jokes. I would take her again.
I thought the class was pretty easy. There's a lot of busy work for homework, but you don't really need to do it. Her handwriting can be kind of annoying. I barely used the textbook...I don't think you even need to buy it. PreCalc is pretty unbearable, but her craziness made it somewhat bearable.
You need the book to teach you because she can't explain anything.
Loved her so much.  Made everything so much easier than the other teachers my friends had.  Great teacher. Would definitely recommend her
The class itself was pretty easy. All we did was draw lines and color for a while (no lie). Then it got a little more difficult, but not too bad. An A in her class is an 87, which is nice. Prange herself was pretty odd. She was pretty spaced out most of the time. Interesting to see but overall she was kind of weird. Overall not too bad a math class
I had no clue what was going on in this class.  The material was tough, and she didn't do a very good job of getting me up to par.  I had to take it in order to get up to speed with calc for engineering.  This class is what made me drop engineering and go to arts and sciences.  She is nuts too...some random ass stuff she says!
Prange was very funny. However, her funnyness didnt mean that the work was easy. The work was hard to me. It required a whole lot understanding what she said. She wrote in script which coule be, at times, annoying because you cant read it. When you are writing notes she speeds up and you cant get a full grasp of the material that she gives.
Prange's class always kept me awake, although it was not always the most interesting class, i did learn a lot, and shes willing to help you.  She gives a lot of opportunity to get extra points from attending class, and doing homework.  Shes a little crazy, talks about ""breaking your kneecaps"" but overall I thought she was a good and I recommend her
Prange is amazing! She's really funny and keeps class interesting. She usually doesn't keep you the full time is you have the 1:15 class. There are quizzes, in class grades and homework so your grade isn't totally based on exams. You have to go to class though because it's a grade and you'll be lost if you don't go.
Prange is literally crazy. She keeps the class interesting because it can get boring very easily. The class is very easy. If you need a math credit, take this but it doesn't count as a group d credit.
Take this math class if u can, it's really easy. Prange is mad funny, kinda crazy. Really helpful during office hours. Only thing is that she had to leave a month before classes ended for medical purposes.
I loved Mrs. Prange! She's absolutely crazy, but it makes the course entertaining and fast. Very sarcastic, but a sweet lady.  Explains things perfectly, homework and exams were a breeze.  She left halfway through the semester for medical leave, and I actually missed her.  If you have to take math, definitely sign up for this class.
She was pretty much awesome.  Boring class but she kept everyone entertained.  At first she may seem like she's going to be a mean teacher, but then you get used to her sarcasm.
she might seem a little weird but i loved her! as boring as the class got she would try to joke around to wake people up. the textbook problems help when its time for the tests, they arent always mandatory but i heard they help besides doing the online course compass work which is tedious but easy to get it all right
Prange is weird. She has a thick accent and likes to threaten to ""break your knee caps"". Her class is good but the work she assigns on course compass is tedious and just ridiculous. That program is hell and it should be scraped. It's impossible to do a math problem on a computer without making a mistake !!!!
shes so spastic and crazy its quite amusing. i attended class just to see what funny things are going to happen. however she is not a good professor. i took precalc in high school and got an A.  i got a D+ in prange's precalc class. she doesnt explain the math, shes just like ""ok this the question and this is the answer"" i relied on coursecompass
I loved her! Definitely weird but, I have a great understanding of everything. She's pretty weird, but you'll love her. Definitely the best Pre-Calc teacher!
She is pretty nice and understanding, but definitely crazy. She doesnt explain things in the best way possible but do the course compass homework and it will help you understand it a lot better","Prange was very funny.

468,"Everything you do has to be so specific. The work itself isn't too hard, but the teacher is anal. Although it may be easy, attendance is mandatory.
Edgmon is really cool! She was extremely helpful. However, sometimes she would ramble, but no one is perfect. She lets you use your notebook and all previous test for help! SUPER EASY!
verrrrry helpful great teacher
You will have a note book nearly 2 inches thick by the time your done. But if you DO the word she asks. And the homework. You will get a good grade. I learned a lot and I don't like math very much.
Easy ""A""!
good attendance is a must if you want an A, there are a lot of chances to improve your grade; extra credit & daily work sheets. Keep up with the homework and you should do well.
I went into this class totally hating math, and extremely irritated with the teacher, but after a while, she grew on me, and i learned a lot and came out of the class with a whole lot more knowledge of intermediate algebra then when i came in. She has a lot of expectations but it is worth it in the end.
Great class..Follow instructions and life is good..Give many extra credit opportunities (all are easy). Test are not to difficult, take notes and do the homework..One should easily get a B.
You can use your notes on everything, so the tests are super easy. She's a pretty good teacher, always willing to help. Do not miss any classes because you will miss out on points. You should have a good understanding of math BA if you are going to take her.
well I didnt like the fact that she didnt have reliable office hours. She seems approachable and loves to chat. Dont be late to class and keep up with the work and the class isnt bad. It's an easy class but keep in mind, this is a math class, so keep up with the homework!
She is an excellent teacher. She explains everything you need to know very thoroughly and she makes it very easy to understand.
I am a 46 year old re-entry student, with four children,two jobs, an extensive legal history and a ferocious desire to learn and succeed. Thank you,Sharon, for helping me cultivate an understanding of this difficult material. I am writing to recommend and encourage others to consider your class as a healthy environment to master this subject
She makes you do orange sheets everyday that are somewhat irrelevant to what your doing in class.She gives you papers called 'motivations' and goes on 20 min rants before actually starting the lecture. her test are nothing like the examples she uses or what your used to seeing from the textbook.IF YOU NEED TO PASS 2 GO ON TO STATS SHES NOT THE ONE
Take this class if you are scared of math. She specializes in math phobia's, she is very, very helpful. Highly recommended.
Sharon is the best. If you want her class better jump on it because it fills up fast. People search for her because she is spoke of highly by the students that have taken her. She puts math in understandable terms and completly understands that not all people are math people and knows how to change it. I wish she taught all math courses!
Mrs. Edgmond is the BEST math teacher I have every had! She is the instructor you want if you are not a great math student. Test are once a week. Unless you are good at math you have to do the HW. Daily hand outs must be completed for an A in the class. Take notes. Getting an A in math is very possible! Higly recommened instructor.
Mrs. Edgmon is an outstanding math instructor! If you think you are bad at math she might convice you other wise. She will spend extra time with students to help them understand math. Must do handouts in order to get good grade in class!
Professor Edgmon's main goal is to make sure you understand math.  The class does require some effort, but the payoff is well worth it.  Take this class if you believe you at bad at math.  You may change your mind after finishing the semester.
She's inconsistent. She tries to help you but goes pretty fast when lecturing, and tends to go on religious tangents. Her tests include formulas we've studied, but the problems are often not like what's in the book or on her lectures content wise, so they're like ""trick questions"". Very frustrating.",She is an excellent teacher. She explains everything you need to know very thoroughly and she makes it very easy to understand.
470,"He is a great professor, gives excellent feedback, and cares for his students. The only thing is that he does not use canvas; his way of communication is by email. This course requires a coursebook, and there is lots of homework. Overall, he is a great professor.
If you hate public speaking, this is the man for you.
Professor Staller is great! He's a pretty easy grader. There's a lot of homework, but it's very manageable! 
Near the beginning of the class there was a lot of homework, but it is all useful for later assignments. I would recommend taking him, but be warned there is a lot of homework, and definitely pay attention to due dates for homework and speeches.
I loved this professor! if you are nervous of joining a communication class, I totally recommend taking Mr. Staller! he's very caring, if you ever need help make sure you ask!! or join his after school hours! I appreciate all of the advice he gave him. will most definitely take him again.
Best teacher I have ever had! I was scared to take this class because I have anxiety but he makes it so easy to speak up and get involved. So sad some people dropped because they all got afraid to do the first speech but all his work is so easy!! It is a lot but if you stay on top of it you will be fine. His office hours are very helpful!!
a true gem! I loved him he was such a sweet old man. many students sadly took advantage of his easy grading. Very positive and happy person who truly loved his teaching subjects. Cares about students and respects their cultures
Oh boy, where do I start? Amazing person/teacher, however this was one of the most unusual classes I've ever taken. Class tends to be awkward when there's little participation. So much homework! 7-8 pages of workbook material due every class, on top of numerous (although easy) papers. Be prepared to dedicate serious time to this class.
Dr Staller is a very good professor. Follow the syllabus closely and make sure you stay ahead of the due dates. The speech outlines take time to write and I recommend visiting the professor during his office hours or just before class. Get a supplemental group leader if you can, the SI program is perfect for this course.
Professor Staller is great! He lets you makeup absences by going to his office hours. Hw is due every class but its all in the book. Very easy! and he does allow late work! Midterms are on the hw you do! answers are all in book as well. hes not a hard grader at all. We didnt have a final either. You cant fail!
This is a good alternative to the regular speech class. You will still give several presentations, but Dr Staller will see you through. You will be teamed with 5 other students in a group. Half of my group did not complete the class. Dr Staller lectures very little, the groups present the chapters. Follow the syllabus closely!
Stallar was opposed to anyone who challenged or questioned him. He is very biased and discriminatory.
Mr. Staller is always in a good mood. He makes class fun. The workload isnt too bad. Everything is straight from the book including speeches. Speeches are easy if you follow the set structure. This class is hard to fail. Show up do your work and youll pass.
Very good Profesor
Easy A. Read the chapter, do the workbook, and give your speeches. Staller has the class set up where you will pass just by showing up and doing everything assigned. You get the A by doing everything and doing well on the speeches and the final. Final questions are given ahead of time. Speeches aren't bad/hard if you know the material.
Mark makes you buy a textbook which he wrote so he also gets money when you buy it. He doesn't use canvas! when he grades he can't understand his own handwriting. Very messy, he doesn't lecture and makes you do speeches about his book. He estimates your grade. Makes you do 1 hour long speeches and makes you buy a binder you don't use.
Mark Staller is the single best teacher I've ever had. Though he has homework due ever class day, he makes it easy for you to do it and to learn. Homework and attendance are mandatory if you want to pass the class. However, if you are late on homework he will let you get it to him by next class and still get credit. Joyful and fun, he is the best.
Great professor! I would definitely take this class again if I needed another communication class. He's really nice and the class is actually pretty fun because you become friends with the people in your small groups. He's an easy grader and he makes sure that the class is easy to pass, you just need to show up and do your work.
This class is NOT easy!! I learned so much but I dropped other classes to keep up in this one. Professor Staller is very nice, taught me so much , and expects alot of his students. He is a very fair grader and makes this class fun and interesting.  I would highly recommended him. He's a brilliant man and I value everything he taught me.","He is a great professor, gives excellent feedback, and cares for his students. The only thing is that he does not use canvas; his way of communication is by email. This course requires a coursebook, and there is lots of homework. Overall, he is a great professor."
471,"Professor Acosta is a fair person however the class can be hard if you don't keep up with the work. She provides good feedback. If you want to pass, just keep up with the work.
Assigns a lot of homework but is very helpful and lets you resubmit assignments for a chance to get full points.
I didnt like this class at all. I would not take from this professor again. I didnt feel good in class.
She is very compassionate with her subject of teaching. I really liked her positive and uplifting personality. And the fact that she is very understanding and makes it her goal to get students to become more ignited in their speeches, helping the audience feel a sense of connection is the best part of her class.
What if I told you that by the end of this class, I had completed 98 assignments total. And that you would be given 6+ assignments per week, that weren't short. All while dealing with the class being THREE HOURS LONG. Think you'll get out early? Think again. You're there until the last second, and even later on some days.
I usually don't do reviews but I really like Helen Acosta! I have 2 MA degrees and her class is pretty hard. I don't mean ""hard"" in the sense of tests but she does assign lots of homework. Ms. Acosta has very good lectures and really puts her all into them. She cares about her students. She does provide extra credit opportunities so take advantage!
My first year at bc. not impressed. She gives way too much homework and keeps her students until the end of class and a couple of times over. If you get lucky and happen to get out early it's only because she has work to do. Very anti-religion and found her to be offensive (I'm Catholic) Avoid at all costs.
This professor teaches well but at times can be lacking. Can be slow on grading and usually will make excuses. Speeches were easy and she made you feel comfortable.
Shes the communication chair, so she knows what shes doing. Shes also really nice.
A good teacher who is caring and gives lots of homework but is fair and will work with you.
in class she seemed nice and caring but when I talked to her by myself several she was rude, distant and cold.
Professor is very nice. she is very sweet and understanding. BUT you will speak so beware if you are shy. There are 4 speeches, 2 are  7 mins long and the rest are short.
Helen Acosta is a very loving and kind person.  She cares for her students and will help you every step of the way. There is a ton of homework, but I guarantee that you will learn many skills in her class that you are definitely going to need throughout your college career.  Best teacher ever!!
I really looked forward to Intercultural Communications at the beginning, by the end I had no regrets about taking this class with this teacher! She's an amazing person who made class feel safe, I looked forward to going. LOTS of hw, as long as you stay on top of it you'll be fine because it's not hard. She makes class fun, I grew a lot as a person
Caring, focused, knowledgeable and kind. She is an engaging speaker with a lot of great in class group activities to demonstrate the course material. She has a ton of office hours so no excuses. She'll help you get an A if you show investment. Offers extra credit but be prepared for a TON OF HOMEWORK. Would take again.
If you gonna take Comm B6 find a better teacher, way to much homework for a 3 unit class, she is the kinda of teacher who enjoys giving homework and says stuff like ""oh you thought the first part of your semester was easy"" "" because I'm not the nice one, here's this week's homework "" worst 16 weeks of my life.
Seriously there's way to much homework. Homework consist of 1 reading guide 3pgs, 1 journal 3pgs, 4 activity pages 1-3pgs long front & back, and a term project normally 2pgs long for 1 week alone. Just way to much busy work, Helen is there to help! But get ready for a long weekend of Homework. Binder checks make you do the all the work or no points
You will have a lot of homework in this class, which will account for forty percent of your grade, the class is not difficult but it is very time consuming, the lectures are very interesting and you break out of your shell after taking this class, the presentations and the techniques she teaches are very helpful and informative.
Extreme amount of homework , i became unmotovated when i got a zero on my first assignment that took days to finish because it was pages and pages all because i forgot one line :( shes Seems nice but she can be meanish / smart mouth
She is a great professor!!!  If you have kids and a job I wouldn't recommend taking this class THERE IS TONS OF HOMEWORK!!!! if you aren't a homework person don't set yourself up for failure!!!! Other than that.... EASY A if you do the work!!!!","She is very compassionate with her subject of teaching. I really liked her positive and uplifting personality. And the fact that she is very understanding and makes it her goal to get students to become more ignited in their speeches, helping the audience feel a sense of connection is the best part of her class."
476,"If you want an A in the class and science doesn't come easy to you, you are going to have to study regularly. Her exams are based off of her lecture notes but the book helps explain cycles better because there are more pictures in them. Go to every class and ASK QUESTIONS! The labs can be difficult. Attend class and lab or grade will suffer.
If your premed I guarantee you will meet more Professors just like Garrison. She is a tough grader but fair. Participation is a must!!! Textbook was rarely used but is still good to get if you can to strengthen your knowledge on her lectures. Lectures are important but she talks her very fast (review her powerpoints before lecture and print them).
This class is pretty fast paced and requires you to stay on top of your game. You have lab and lecture and a test in both for each unit you cover. I've gotten anywhere from c's to d's on those but I'm still ending the semester with a B so you have a lot of other assignments to balance the grades out. Work hard from day one and you'll do just fine.
Professor Garrison is one of the best professors I've ever had. This class is for biology majors, IT IS NOT EASY. But show up, pay attention, and study as much as you can and you will do great! She is always ready to help you and truly cares about her students. As biology majors, this is probably one of the easiest classes you'll take, so studyyy!
If you are not prepared to work, do not take this class. She is a fair professor and will try to give you as many points as she can but you have to put in the work to earn your grade.
DO NOT take Biology with Garrison. Expects you to know things not mentioned in textbook, tests are ridiculously tough, and extremely anal. Has multiple choice on tests, but its actually multiple-multiple choice. If you're hoping to get an A in this course, do not even bother taking it with her. You need more than a great memory to pass.
Garrison means well, but doesn't do well when it comes to teaching B3A. Only take this class if you plan on having perfect attendance for the semester and if you have transportation out of town for the two projects required. Lots of outside studying time will be needed to understand that vast amount of material covered. 
The material is kind of hard, but she is the most organized professor I have had. She strongly follows her syllabus.  You really need to study and don't miss class or assignments, in order to get an A.
MS GARRISON WAS VERY HELPFUL. IF YOU DO ALL THE WORK AND SHOW UP FOR LABS AND STUDY YOULL G AN A. I LOVED THE FIELD TRIPS WE GOT TO DO AS OUR PROJECT AND EXTRA CREDIT. I WENT KAYAKING AND WHALE WATCHING AND I DID LEARN ALOT. POWERPOINTS ONLINE AND SHE HAS STUDY GUIDES FOR RY EXAM INCLUDING THE FINAL. GREAT TEACHER
Professor Garrison is very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, she has a lot of busy work that she only collects once in awhile and her lectures are exceedingly boring. However, the powerpoints are posted online.
She is extremely nice and gives you a lot to study for but he final exam was a piece of cake and she really works with you and to improve your grade. Very interesting class and I would take classes from her again!
Professor Garrison is a cool teacher both inside and outside of class. She is fun and will definitely make sure you learn to think AND write better. However, you do have to work for your grades.
Professor Garrison is a very good professor. She expects students to learn and is demanding of them, resulting in low reviews. Her tests are challenging but come directly out of her notes. She is older so she follows her lecture notes, but is still very effective. I have read and heard her lectures are ""boring"" but I beg to differ!
Very difficult teacher, doesn't grade fairly across the board. I wanted to major in biology til I took her. If you can get a different teacher other than her you will be better off.
Mrs. Garrison is reasonable and knows her stuff. Tests are hard but she provides extra credit opportunities to make up for it. Showing up to lab is a MUST, you get 10 points just for being there, plus she gives a quiz every lab. A lot of points are missed out on if you don't show up. I struggled but managed to pass with a good grade!
If you are not a science major you might want to choose another professor. Tests are hard!
She is a great teacher, very smart, but expects WAY too much out of a junior college class.  Tests are very hard and extensive, her lectures go very fast and info is easily missed, she goes over material only once, review sessions do not involve her, students bring in own materials and study together.  She's a great teacher, but if you have more th
Mrs. Garrison is extremely knowledgeable, and you can learn a lot, but you have to work for it. It's not easy, and lectures can be boring, but there is lots of information in them. She is all business, so take this class if you want to learn, don't take it if you want to have lots of fun.
If you are gifted in knowledge of Biology, it doesn't matter what teacher you have. I am not very good at science. If you don't have a car, don't take this class, there are 3 required field trips. If you don't have all the time in the world to devote to studying, don't take this class... No study guides. Tons of assignments...buy a lot of paper!
Tests cover lecture material and you get points just for showing up to the labs.  Although there is a lot of material and I didn't want to take the class I ended up finding it really interesting and managed to do better than I thought I would .. showing up is key","Professor Garrison is very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, she has a lot of busy work that she only collects once in awhile and her lectures are exceedingly boring. However, the powerpoints are posted online."
477,"Many people commenting don't understand that he's a really approachable professor. He grades tough but if you actually dedicate time to his additional readings and due dates on the canvas calendar, there are no issues. While the syllabus is a little dated, his Canvas page is organized by module so you only need to access it for add. readings. 
Do not take him. He is outdated, class does not make sense, so much pointless reading required. Harsh grader, syllabus and online assignments do not match. I didn't do a second part of an assignment because of this. You need to double check all deadline in the syllabus and online.
This course requires a lot of work. If youre willing to put in hours and hours of work, you will pass. The online exercises are very helpful for the exams. Pay close attention to deadlines.
Took this class online; it was fairly simple. He posted a paper with our assignments and their due dates. Super helpful, you can always e-mail him if you have any questions. Only thing I didn't like was the final, too many questions in so little time.
Online class. Pretest. By the numbers. Lacked life.
I haven't started this online class yet but if you choose to do so, beware that he makes you buy one specific font for $25, with an $8 downloading fee. It's a complete scam and there's no way around it as far as I can see. I'm pissed that I had to waste my money on this useless font, but it's essential or you can't see any of the class material.
Fun teacher.  Took Vampires in lit, folk, film. Fun course.  There is one paper at the end of the quarter that was 8 pages long, but he requires APA format instead of MLA.  You are required to do discussion mods online, but at the end of the quarter you get to watch a bunch of vampire movies.  His lectures were super fun. He is a nice teacher.
This isn't a class, it's a computer program.  I recommend you avoid this and take a face to face class with a prof where you really learn something.
I took this class online.  When I was confused about the syllabus he responded to my email very quickly.  If you actually pay attention to the practice tests you will do well on the real tests.  I'm not sure why the reviews are so bad, the class wasn't bad at all! 
I thought this  class easy as long as you study and complete the assignment exercises  you will do fine. I never really used one of the books. There are A LOT!! of test that you need to take so you need to dedicate time to it. Practice exercises are timed but you can take as many times as you like. Test are timed and can only take once! 
Tool
You have to take all the exams and do well. Study hard, it is a very hard class.
I never used one of the books I bought.  It was Lectures in the Structure of English Edition: 2nd.  It was just all of his pwr pt presentations printed and binded together to form a book.  I wish I would've saved $30 by not buying it.  But the class itself was not bad at all.  You definitely have to dedicate time.  Take good notes =)
Dr. Carlisle is the best professor at CSUB I have ever had.  The material is difficult and kinda boring to most people, but his sense of humor and incredible knowledge of his discipline make the class much more enjoyable than I expected.  Engl 319 is the most useful class I've taken in college, and that is largely due to Dr. Carlisle' teaching.
Took the class online, textbook not necessary. The class is EXTREMELY difficult, this class will need to be your MAIN focus when you take it. He is not available and it takes him days to respond to emailed questions. I received A's on every test but the final exam & ended up with a C, he's very difficult to work with.
He's a bit fast paced, so you might want to have some caffine before you attend class. Other than that I really can't complain. Although the material can be quite difficult and confusing at time he really does put his best effor understand what is going on. His demands are very fair. I would higly recommed him.
I took professor Carlisle class online. At first it was difficult to comprehend. Once I got the hang of it, it was not that difficult to understand how to maneuver through the coarse. BUT the class in itself is extremely difficult. The beginning is extremely difficult. We had test every two weeks throughout the quarter. The Final is 30%. GOOD LUCK
Dr. Carlisle is a fabulous instructor.  He loves his subject, knows it well, and shares his enthusiasm.  His sense of humor is delightful, and his lectures are informative.  He rocks!
I took this class online while living in the AV. It's a very difficult class that you HAVE to stay on top of and make sure you understand. The tests are online as well but you are required to go to the lab to take them. The class work is very time consuming so make sure you have the time.
I took the English 319 class online and it was very difficult!! I failed the class and have an A/B average in all other classes. There was so much work and it was very difficult and time consuming! Seemed like way more work than allowed for the 10 weeks. Also you had to go on campus to take the exams. Make sure your schedule allows for that.","Do not take him.

479,"Prof. Julian is an eccentric guy and a good instructor. Our only grades were three big assignments (one for each text) and a final project. He encourages participation and his banter with students is quite fun. My only real complaint would be that the big assignments he calls ""non-essays/non-quizzes"" are, in fact, just essays/quizzes. 
Professor Yates is the best. He handled the coronavirus transition to online in the best way possible. I really appreciate his dedication and you can tell that he really has a passion for the texts. Take his class if you like engaging in light, comedic banter as a way to learn. Also,Make sure to match his vibe or else it will be a long class.
Julian is an odd yet amazing professor! There is a fair amount of reading but most of Shakespeare's plays can be found online for free. He makes the text very easy to understand. Attendance in taken but the environment is so chill, I didn't mind going. Essays are graded a little harshly but you learn to write what he expects of you.
Some of the things we read for this class made no sense to me, but if you listen to the lectures and take notes, you'll do alright, and ASK QUESTIONS, bring up discussion points, do anything, and you'll feel better for it. He gets to know everyone in the class and wants to see you do well. Be prepared to read a lot, but it's worth it.
Prof. Yates is a great teacher. Even though the texts are old, he finds ways to make them interesting. There readings are reasonable. He really wants to help you become a better writer and makes great comments on your essays to help you improve. I definitely recommend this class.
Prof. Yates is a great teacher. He always connects the texts to modern life in an interesting way. The reading is reasonable, and there are 5 short essays--no tests. Definitely would recommend for British Lit.
I took him for Zombie Madness topic... AWESOME class. We watching videos and he asked for your suggestions too. The reading was pretty interesting not all gore and guts type zombies. I actually liked going. His British slang made listening to his lectures a good time. Would definitely take any other classes with him. 
Yates is an amazing professor and he's hilarious. He assigns six papers and drops your lowest grade. All you have to do is read what he assigns and write a 2-4 page essay on it. No exams. No final. I learned a lot about my writing ability because of this class. Definitely take it if you like literature and writing. It also boosted my gpa a lot.
He's a really nice guy and class is actually pretty interesting, but he grades pretty harshly on essays. Reading Logs are graded a little easier but he has really specific things he looks for in essays and if he doesn't find it you'll get a really average grade
Yates is a wonderful human being. He's very down to earth and funny, and totally cool with giving extensions. However, I hated the material, and mostly struggled to stay awake during his lectures
Although he doesn't really respond to students' input, he's always willing to listen and to create discussion. He's a TON of fun in class and makes awkward jokes :)
Great teacher, funny, energetic,and knowledgeable. His assistant not so much she grades inconsistently. Go for his discussion class. You'll learn a lot from him.
fun and interesting. learning brit lit from a guy with a british accent-can't go wrong. class is good, he's super nice, grading is a little tough but i would say hes definitely one of the better english teachers in the department.
his accent is the best! great teacher, loves what he's doing.  not a bad grader.  gave 6 short essays .. u'll love going to class! he's awesome
He made this class extremely enjoyable.. Yates is one of the best professors I've had, made all of the Shakespeare texts easy to comprehend.
Genius. Loves the talking heads and the magnetic fields. talk punk with him. he'll love you. also, one of the smartest people you're likely to meet. if you don't mind working hard and learning a lot, take his class. also--watch for his class on the FETISH. it's brilliant.
Really nice guy and genuinely interested in seeing his students succeed. Circle discussions can be intimidating if you're shy, especially since the students do 90% of the talking, but it's a pretty good class.
Yates is an awesome professor, which helped to make an otherwise dull subject interesting. His Britich accent was so funny and his laidback attitude made the class more relaxed. Class participation is important, but he's very open which makes it easier to talk. I'd recommend him to anyone.
He can be helpful with papers and whatnot.  However, his idea of using a circle formation in class is both intimidating and unneccesary.  Beware of the circe!!
Brit-Lit I with Yates was awesome. He made the readings, however dry some might have been, as interesting as possible and left plenty of room for discussion among the students. The papers were fun to write, and there were no exams to stress over!","Julian is an eccentric guy and a good instructor. Even though the texts are old.

480,"Our class only had about 10 people in it so participation mattered. It was nice though since everyone was involved in the group discussions. Professor Rashid was so nice and made learning Spanish easy and fun. The homework was time consuming but other than that, I enjoyed SPA 2025. 
she has a lot of good reviews because she's not a bad teacher. She's very passive-aggressive though. and gosh forbid you miss class, she's super extra about that even though when I registered for this course it said it was hybrid on her syllabus, that was a fat lie so that wasn't cool on her part. so much work for this class, homework takes hours
Shes not a tough grader really. Criteria is pretty clear. Took her because she was the only option but I wouldve rather not. Ive never appreciated professors that require attendance for class especially mid pandemic not me tho yall stay safe
Translation is a relatively tough class with a lot of assignments, but I feel like I genuinely grew from this class. The quality of your work matters. You review grammar again. She's not overly harsh, but every detail counts. You really learn the intricacies of the language. Great class! Rashid is a good choice.
Sra. Rashid was really nice! Her class wasn't too difficult but there is a lot of homework so don't fall behind. Her lectures were pretty straightforward, we just go over what's covered in the textbook. A positive and negative is that class goes by really quick but that usually means she has to rush lecture and breakout room practice.
I loved Profesora Rashid! She's sweet and really insightful about Spanish literature. This class exposes you to a broad array of Spanish genres and writing styles from different time periods which I appreciated. Try engaging in class and coming prepared having read the textbook readings because that's what lecture is completely built around.
One of the tougher classes Ive taken. She is very disorganized and unclear about assignments. She spends the whole class correcting homework and rushes through lecture. A lot of learning is on your own. Lots of textbook and online homework given, at least 8 hours every week. Although she is nice and funny, it is hard to get an A in her class.
Professor Rashid is really kind and caring. She really cares about her students and does a good job and presenting the material in both Spanish and English, for the most part. I think she's a fair grader, and so much fun! I very much enjoyed her class.
Prof Rashid is very kind and cares about her students. She is a good teacher. That being said I hated this class as it was ridiculously easy for me. I could tell a lot of my classmates that started their Spanish at WSU struggled, but if you studied elsewhere and/or can maintain a conversation in Spanish, this class will be just an easy A checkbox.
Make sure you go to class and are paying attention, most of what she talks about in class is what is on the exam. An understanding teacher, but a decently tough grader so make sure you are working hard. Need to go to class and participate.
She's a good professor, just a tough grader. Be ready to put in some work. If you participate she's nicer to you. Tests are VERY LONG. There are cultural reports you have to go out and find events for to write about, kind of inconvenient but lots of points, and some papers. She's very smart, and very good at Spanish.
Do not take this professor unless you want to spend 90% of your life focused on her class alone. She is an extremely hard grader ( marking five points off for misplacing an accent mark). She is very critical and tends to play favorites. I love Spanish very much, however after her class I wanted to change my minor.
Profesora Rashid is just great. She is so nice and you can tell she genuinely cares about her students. She is clear on classroom expectations and usually goes over rubrics for assignments to make it easier. She is very enthusiastic about literature and makes it less difficult to understand and analyze. Fair grader too. Highly recommend.
She's literally a sweet, hip grandma. She's very encouraging and tries to bring out your confidence in the language, and is very receptive to questions or extra help. Is flexible on due dates if you need it, and is honestly very fun and hilarious. The book is required, and there is some homework but nothing too bad. You have to go to class to pass.
The class environment is very relaxed. Very habitual in the structure of content covered in each chapter, so it's easy to catch up if you miss class. Light homework, with a few major writing assignments (1-2 pages). Always willing to help and gives good detailed feedback. Doesn't upload grades to Blackboard so you have to calculate your own grade.
Rashid is amazing! She really cares about her students. I had her for 3 semesters and would definitely recommend her! She is the reason I am a minor (and now major) in Spanish. Yes you have to work hard, but oh well! An A is possibly and likely if you put in the effort. It is so worth it in the end. She is BEYOND helpful if you ask. Take her! 
She really cares about her students. I have taken her for 4 difference classes. All her classes require a lot of work but it isn't too difficult. She changes her mind and the syllabus a lot. She seems to always have too much scheduled for one class period. As long as she thinks you are making an efforts then you will do fine.
She has a great character: she's kind and patient, yet firm when necessary. Although we fell behind every day, I felt that the class was organized well. She gave us lots of chances to give feedback. Her sense of humor made class relaxed and not stressful. She graded pretty exactingly for this class; the work was tough, but I learned a whole lot.
She is a really good professor. She pushes you to your most outer limit and encourages more. The course is what it is and she incorporates different elements of the culture too. Fun class, good teacher, do your work and you will be fine :)
Prof. Rashid is one of the BEST! We used the textbook a lot, but she knows how to keep class interesting. She is so honest and fun and EXTREMELY HELPFUL. She is very clear and easy to understand. DEFINITELY TAKE HER CLASS!",Criteria is pretty clear. she's not a bad teacher. This class exposes you to a broad array of Spanish genres and writing styles from different time periods which I appreciated.
482,"Dennis is very interesting and I find him very entertaining. He is very explicit in what he wants and doesn't like to be emailed. The class is only two online exams which he basically copy and pastes from quizlet...and 5 papers which are time consuming. Overall, I didn't think the class was difficult but I can see how some find it useless. 
Prof Malaret was a very friendly, caring man but a horrible professor. His lectures were boring, hard to follow, and had little relation to the content on the exams. The course was graded on two long and difficult exams.The only reason I went to class was because he promised extra credit for attendance but I haven't seen that in the gradebook yet. 
WORST professor i have ever had. do NOT recommend taking any class of his. It is graded by two exams and an essay which he does not give any clarification about. the material on the exams is NOT at all what is covered in class, so it's pretty much a guessing game. he tells his students not to email him and gets mad if you ask questions/email him. 
He is a horrible professor. He just talked about his chickens and expected to learn from it. You have to teach yourself from the book or you will not be successful in the class. 
Prof Malaret is a really great guy who always makes class fun and easygoing. He is very laid back, and his class is pretty chill. He grades pretty easily as long as he can tell you put effort into the assignment. Lectures are lengthy and attendance is required to pass. Extra credit is offered if you have good attendance. 
This class was not what I expected. Professor is nice, but clearly states he will not respond to emails. Grading criteria are always unclear. It's a good class as long as you contribute and put effort into it. Ask questions in person, not through emails! He is a REALLY tough grader and will give you a 0 if you don't put effort into it.
Super easy class to pass. Lectures are boring and tend to not be very informative. Extra credit is offered only to students who attend the class on a regular basis. The textbook is required to pass. Start the research paper early! He does not offer extentions
This class is super easy to pass as long as you pay attention to the guidelines he gives you. His lectures are not helpful since he tends to rant a lot. If you're looking for an easy A, this is the class for you.  The grade is based on 2 exams + a paper. Show up, take notes, do the reading, submit stuff on time =  A. 
A pretty nice guy, but a terrible professor. Would not recommend him at all.
Discourages questions. Discourages student emails. Lectures are full of tangents. No assignments, graded purely on poorly constructed exams. Vague on expectations and instructions. Refused to answer many questions in class regarding dates.
Does go on irrelevant tangents during class but you can tell he loves his job. His approach to student emails is pretty negative but if you find him after class he will answer your questions. Overall very nice personality, but totally could put a bit more effort into communicating with students and being transparent on expectations.
Hands down the worst professor I have ever had. Attendance was not mandatory and even if it was I wouldn't go. Goes off on random tangents in lecture. Is very vague and reiterates constantly not to email him. Exams are poorly written with many mistakes, and being your only grades besides a research paper, it is very rough. DO NOT TAKE!
I hated everything about this class.
Will not answer emails. Does not give rubrics because ""you should know what to expect"". Clearly states he will give you a 0 on an assignment if he doesn't like it. Based on 2 exams, questions and answers are worded poorly, and one paper, that he never approved anyone's paper proposal for over two months. I'm an A student, couldn't get higher than C
The beginning of the semester was fine. Once we went online due to COVID, things turned for the worst. He doesn't even have wifi at his house. Props to most profs for figuring things out quickly, not Prof Malaret. We got a total of about 3 emails during quarantine and were told not to email him at all because he ""gets annoyed by student emails"".
Professor does not have WIFI at his home and does not contact students. Once we went online it took him 2 weeks to assign us an exam and a paper. He did not clarify the due dates and gave us a rubric for the paper that was dated back from 2008. He told us to not email him questions, and if we did we were told ""to not tell him how to do his job"".
Easily one of the worst professors Ive ever had. He was completely inaccessible outside of class & routinely told my class to not ask him questions via email. He never stayed on topic in class & gave tests that were heavy on info he never touched on. My class only had 2 exams & a final project so an A was impossible if you did badly on one thing.
Accent did not bother me, I could figure out what he was saying. He is very nice and cares about students. However, I found his class to be VERY unorganized. Blackboard is all over the place, lectures didnt stay on topic and he would say he sent out emails that I have no record of receiving. Its doable but not enjoyable.
Professor Malaret is a very nice guy and he is really caring towards his students, and you can really tell that he enjoys his job a lot. But, he just stands up front and rants about things that don't really pertain to the course and it can get really boring. I would just download the powerpoints for class and then take notes out of the book.
He is a genuine guy and talks to his students like they are his friends. Yes, he is a bit hard to understand at first, but I was able to pick up on his accent quickly. The only thing I don't like is how few things we are graded on. Three tests and a final project. However, you can tell he just loves his job and wouldn't trade it for anything.",Dennis is very interesting and I find him very entertaining. He grades pretty easily as long as he can tell you put effort into the assignment.
483,"Dr. Groh is incredible as a professor and advisor, but she doesn't go light on any course. I had CHEM 111 and 112. Those courses felt like getting gut punched repeatedly for two semesters, and 2/3 of the students who entered dropped out of the major, but I came out of it so much more knowledgeable and prepared for the future courses my major has.
Dr. Groh was one of my favorite professors. Her class was extremely difficult, and I wish I had put in the time to go see her during office hours to get help. She cares about her students and puts in so much effort. Original test material so you NEED to study. One of the most caring profs and I wish I could take her again.
The class is difficult not because the professor is bad, but because the material is challenging. That being said, the quality of lectures is very good, lots of study materials and it is defiantly possible to do well with effort. Do not blow off problem sets and be ready to form study groups. Exams are hard, but doable. Very good honors class.
If chemistry is part of your major, or you enjoy it, have Groh as a professor! The class cycles every three weeks with the first being no assignments, the second having a problem set due, and the third having an exam. Problem sets are difficult and time consuming but you're allowed to work together. Extremely helpful for problem solving skills.
best chem professor in UD
Susan Groh is as good as you can hope for from an introductory chemistry course. She gives such a good overview of the material that you'll need for the next years, and it's a joy if you enjoy chemistry. Terribly hard, but you can work for it and pass.
Incredibly difficult but sincerely intelligent and caring. If you want a comprehensive chemistry background, this is the class to take. Be prepared to work. Her point recapture system is the best mechanism for ensuring that you learn and retain all the material in the class. Fair grader.
Just like in the fall, Prof. Groh was outstanding. When not discussing important chemistry principles, Groh went into great detail about real-world applications of the concepts. Still, CHEM112 was a very challenging class; be prepared to invest lots of time into problem sets, making orgo flashcards, reviewing discussion keys, and etc. Great course!
Groh was one of the highlights of my Freshman fall, and if every class was taught with her level of attention and care I don't doubt I could learn anything. She loves chemistry, and the only thing that she cares about more are her students learning. Still, get ready to work. Yes she curves. Yes people still got F's. It's not easy, but it's worth it
Even if you had a strong background in AP chemistry, this class is a nightmare. If you don't immediately retain everything from her dense lectures, you will spend hours upon hours on the homework and studying for exams. All grades except the final include partial credit, which is lenient and is the only reason why I passed. Very demanding class.
Wonderful professor; has a real wealth of knowledge. She gives really interesting lectures. Groh is very accommodating of the needs of the students and is a fantastic resource. Her class, while very challenging, is also incredibly rewarding. The problem sets and exams should not be taken lightly.
Dr. Groh is the best professor I've ever had! She really cares about her students and it's obvious that she truly enjoys teaching freshmen. She's patient, understanding, brilliant, funny, and she really wants her students to succeed; not just in her class but in every aspect of their lives. She's such a wonderful woman!
Material may appear straightforward, but the exams and problem sets extend well beyond lectures -- be prepared to WORK and STUDY. The exams are very tough, perhaps too tough for an introductory chemistry class designed for first-year students. It may be best to take the non-Honors section and ease into the coursework of freshman year.
My best professor. She's so caring and gives students food during her office hours and exams. Her lectures are amazing and cannot be skipped; the amount of material covered per lecture is high. Class is super fast-paced and the exams test you on EVERYTHING you learn. Her problems are very good. With her classes, you'll be prepared for future chem!
Professor Groh understands chemistry extremely well and teaches it in a rewarding and engaging manner. The class will challenge you, but was definitely worth it. She is also a very kind and helpful lady.
The most caring teacher I have ever had. She really wants the students to learn. If you need extra help, go to office hours and she will make sure that you understand. The exams are the hardest exams I have ever taken, the first one will end you. However, if you really put the work in and go to extra help, you will see that hard work pays off.
TAKE THIS CLASS. I had the opportunity to take chem classes beyond the scope of AP Chem in high school, but Dr. Groh's class gave me a broader and more in depth understanding of chemistry than all of those classes combined. My only regret is that I won't be able to take another class with her after CHEM112H. Oh, and do your problem sets early!
Groh is truly a wonderful professor who loves to teach and seriously cares about her students. The class is hard as hell with very long problem sets and the exams are easily harder than anything you have ever taken in high school. Unless you have a lot of experience with chemistry don't take the class. But if you have her, get ready to study HARD.
Pros: Terrific person. Cares about your grades. We got to hold liquid nitrogen. She is basically the perfect professor Cons: Stupid hard class. It ain't high school anymore, ya bunch of kittens
A really tough course especially if your Chemistry background is not entirely strong. Professor Groh is very knowledgeable and willing to help you understand the content covered in class as much as possible. Exams are difficult but manageable with intensive review and Problem Sets are really difficult.  DO NOT PROCRASTINATE!!","She gives such a good overview of the material that you'll need for the next years. the material is challenging.

485,"Dr. Wu is great. He is a very passionate instructor, insanely smart, and honestly one of the more caring teachers I've had. He does have a tendency to go on tangents and he expects you to do a lot of learning on your own, but he is very fair about it. I've had him for 3 classes now and he is wonderful when you actually learn to work with him.
Professor Wu knows what he is talking about, but he doesn't make it easy for students to understand. I enjoyed the contents of this class, but I just wish he was better at explaining things and giving us more example materials. Do not take professor Wu if you can't learn on your own, or don't have time to look up things outside of class. 
Professor Wu was very funny and kind in class, but he is not the professor to take for this class. It's definitely a difficult topic, and he has a hard time reexplaining things sometimes. Like I said, he's a great person, and I'd recommend him for 261, but definitely find someone else for 366. 
Every assignment in Wu's class was done in a group, including his final exam. Attendance is mandatory and he hands out worksheets in class, and full credit is received as long as you try. Wu assigns a group report about every chapter, but it is only 1 page double spaced. I somehow finished the class with an A!  
He is very knowledgeable about the course.
I have never failed a class before taking one of Prof. Wu's classes. The material is difficult to follow and Wu doesn't help one bit. His lectures are dry and tend to go off topic. He can be quite rude to students who don't understand the material. Absolutely would not recommend him as a professor. It was a total nightmare.
He was one of the most frustrating professors I have ever had. He is knowledgable about the content, but has no idea how to teach it. You can learn everything just by reading the book. His lectures are dull and he often wastes time by getting off track. He also never posts grades. His expectations are confusing, as are his explanations.
He is unwilling to make accommodations, even for Covid related absences. Although he is very educated on the topic, he is not good at teaching it. Also, he doesn't post any grades throughout the semester. He also gets off topic often during lectures. He can be very nice, but he can also make rude remarks if you ask for clarification.
Professor Wu is incredibly smart and has a ton of incredible life experience. This class mostly consisted of lectures with power-points, as well as Dr. Wu going off of the given content and sharing stories. Homework assigned pretty regularly. He gets sidetracked pretty easy and lectures can be hard to follow. Don't skip class, you'll miss stuff.
Hes a solid professor with a passion for his field. Highly recommend. But, dont take this class for an easy A. Youll have to be engaged to earn one.
One of the worst teachers I've ever had. He outright refused to explain things a second time, even when nobody in the class understood. Reading the book did not help very often. He would belittle us for not understanding what he was talking about, even if he hadn't explained it yet. Three tests and maybe five assignments make your entire grade.
Professor Wu is very smart, and I think his class would be fun in any other circumstances, but I'm not going to lie, having him online is difficult. I've never really gotten feedback on homework, and his grading system is confusing. Overall I would recommend him as a professor but be prepared to use outside resources, especially if you are online.
Professor Wu is kindly, and fun to talk to, but his grading criteria is incredibly unclear, he has no experience with Blackboard or teaching online, and his answers to questions posed are often lacking and/or outright unhelpful. Given the chance, take someone else's class, especially if the teaching is going to be via Zoom.
This class was online and he had never taught an online class before. No lectures, just powerpoints and reading. Very confusing professor and class overall. Never clear on expectations. He can be nice, but he will also tell you in very rude ways when you are incorrect. Definitely do NOT recommend him. Avoid him if you can. Terrible experience.
This professor was impossible to please and learn from. I truthfully did not learn anything and taught myself the course material from the beginning to end. I DO NOT recommend this professor if you need assistance with hard grammar subjects. Prepare to learn on your own and be insulted if you don't get it.
most confusing professor I have ever had. Many students in class are education majors, not all, but he only teaches through the education lens. Grades based on ""thoughtfulness"", whatever that means. Doesn't actually want your opinion and never actually teaches ANYTHING. Don't ever expect to learn or receive feedback on how you're doing in class
Dr. Wu is soft-spoken, but very knowledgeable about linguistics. He assigns a lot of homework, and is fair in grading. He gives good feedback. His lectures are hard to follow for some. He only tests on what is covered in class. He responds to email very quickly. He connects what you learn to the real world often, and repeats concepts so they stick.
All he does is lecture the entire class. There is little to no student interaction or engagement. His feedback on assignments is unclear and his explanations don't make any sense. So confusing. I was frustrated and confused about what he wanted me to do. Grading and rubrics were unclear (if provided at all).
Dr. Wu is very smart and took plenty of time to explain each new concept. He is very repetitious which is helpful for remembering because the content was difficult. What's nice is he steered clear from the horrid diagram trees introduced in 261. The tests were only difficult if you didn't do the homework, if you did there were never any surprises.
He speaks quietly, which can make it difficult if you sit in the back, but he really knows his stuff! Wonderful pedagogy, fun and always cheerful.",He speaks quietly. This professor was impossible to please and learn from.
486,"Tucker is a nice woman but she's brilliant... so she expects the same from a general education class. She is hard to follow in her classes. Talks on and on and on and it's exhausting to listen to--especially because you're not graded on it. You better look at the syllabus because she won't even tell you about assignments approaching that are due.
Her class is SO SO SO easy. However, she does not stick to her syllabus at all, so that was a bit challenging. Theres no textbook, but a lot of little books to buy. I rarely read but she covered the material in class. Gave a lot of extra credit. Only thing I didn't like was that she doesn't listen to other's opinions, she was ALWAYS right.
The hardest thing about this class was that she didn't stick to her schedule very well. It made it hard to do hw, but honestly half the time I didn't know what I was supposed to read and it never mattered. Her lectures covered all the reading fine. I think her choice of texts was great and loved her as a person. Learned a lot. Easy grader.
Tucker is an...openminded teacher.  She teaches a hard class to teach, attendance is required.  The books are mostly fiction and worthless.  Only two books are factual.  She fails to keep the schedule and often times we were trying to figure out what we had due each day.
At first this professor overwhelmed me. I got my first paper back and got a C- on it and was stunned because prior to this I was a straight A student. However, I stuck it through the end and kept working hard, especially at participating in class. She gave extra credit, and despite doing poorly on all the papers I still got an A. Worth it to try he
Expectations for papers are totally unclear, and she's a very tough grader (totally unfair when expectations aren't clear). Her idea of lesson planning/discussion is to have students read their papers aloud, then tear them apart in front of everyone. Didn't stick to the syllabus, and added a paper at the end.Very nice as a person, terrible prof

Good teacher.  Teaches on many subjects you would not learn any where else.  Must read all material!  Exams ask aboutspecific quotes from books.
This class isn't boring at all if you're interested in the topic of AfricanAmerican women's history and the way AfricanAmer women have shaped & are shaped by American Culture.  No exams only a few small papers&study guides. Personally, I could listen to her talk all day. She's an amazing person and it's one of the best classes I've taken at GVSU.
Prof. Tucker is very helpful, to this day she helps me however she can
This class was very boring.  Beware.
Professor Tucker is a lil crazy, but she's cool. Class is pretty boring but it's been getting a lil better throughout the year, but writing papers for her are hard because what she thinks goes.
All we do is listen to her read aloud or lecture on barely related topics.  Occasional analysis of literature is limited to the most elementary observations.  It's impossible to get a decent grade on a paper if she disagrees with your opinion.
For a literature class, there is not much literary analysis going on. She lists useless dates and information the entire class.  Very unorganized also. Hardly any chances to earn points. One huge exam for the semester. Not a good class at all.
Class is so boring. There aren't many grades for the semester so if you screw one thing up, its over. If she does not agree with your opinion ( or vice-versa) have a good time trying to get a good grade on papers even with good supporting arguments. She isnt impossible, just not very much fun.
Tucker is pretty unorganized, forgets things that she said she'd go over, and even gave us last year's syllabus/schedule by accident!  Her lectures are boring and redundant.  She's very nice, and so far easy, though I haven't had a test or paper for her yet so we'll see how that goes.
Professor Tucker is an AWESOME teacher and person.  She is always open to helping anyone in need.  I have taken a few African American Studies courses with her along with a few English courses and I absolutely love her.  I feel that I have learned more in the courses that she has taught than in anyone elses.  She is AWESOME!!!
Great teacher, and a class with a different feel.  I recommend her to all GVSU students.  Her class was a nice change of pace, a class with good dialogue that actually made you think.
Dr. Tucker is a good, effective teacher.  I learned more in her class than any other I've ever taken.
Unbelievably unorganized--told us day 1 of class that she'd changed 2 novels (that we'd already purchased/read). Which ed. of the Norton? How many assignments? Reading questions, quizzes--no quality analysis demanded. INCREDIBLY boring. What a shame to let such great lit fall through her hands.",she does not stick to her syllabus at all. The books are mostly fiction and worthless.  Only two books are factual.
488,"He was okay - very knowledgeable about the journalism profession, but didn't offer great criticism when it comes to writing the assignments in the course. Reading is not required, but does help give background for discussion. Assignments are a must. Wasn't a terrible professor but lectures are very dull. 
Yagoda was the best journalism professor I had at UD.  If you want an easy ""A,"" don't take his class. Take his class if you want to be a better writer. Granted, he does not coddle students.  In fact, I think some reviews describing his attitude can best be explained by the fact that the apparent apathy and laziness of students disappoints him.
I was really excited to take this class, but it kind of let me down. He's a nice guy overall, but very nit-picky and a bit inept at CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. I'm not sure if I improved my writing skills as a result of this class or if I just learned to write whatever he wanted to hear.
Most work ive ever done for any class! HAve to write 12 stories for the review on top of other assignments. Yagoda is very intellgent and loves teaching however class is very dull
Really nice professor who seems genuinely interested in the success of his students. Some, not all, of the lectures/discussions weren't very useful, but he knows his stuff and will definitely help you if you need it. Don't take 308 unless you really want to write A LOT.
Yagoda is the Man. Take this class.
He is really fun and has a really dry sense of humor that takes some getting used to.  It's ironic his name is like yoda because he is so wise.
Great guy - very dedicated to helping alumni - also a great mentor as he is a highly published journalist
Great writer, not-so-great teacher. Teaching should be more than just showing you someone else's good writing. What about techniques?
Very little instruction and guidance for feature writing. Basically he just showed us articles and expected us to pick up on everything. Easy, but don't expect to learn a whole lot.
Prof. Yagoda is a great professor--go to class and listen and you will learn so much. and, he is so helpful--ur writing will improve so much if you listen to him and his comments on ur papers. very fair teacher. 309 was a great class bc of him
He is interesting but some students don't ""get"" him.  Try to keep up and you will learn a lot.  He really improved my writing.
Listen to this man. He can boring but he knows what he's talking about. Great course.
Yagoda is smart and knowledgable, but class is boring and pointless.  If you go to him he is very helpful - bit of a sarcastic grader though.  Work is do-able esp. if you have taken other journalism classes before.
The smartest man in the world,great journalist.Love him!!!
Raise hand, give opinion  & he says, ""err, no, that's not what I'm looking for.""
Ya-BOR-dah... so boring no wonder everyone plays on the computer during his clas
Knows a TON about journalism, very helpful and supportive, great prof!
his way or the highway, definitely. will tear up your papers, amusing though
Ya-GO-Da Hell is the nickname, Boring lectures, arrogant, but not a bad class.","Yagoda was the best journalism professor I had at UD.  If you want an easy ""A,"" don't take his class. He's a nice guy overall, but very nit-picky and a bit inept at CONSTRUCTIVE criticism."
489,"She is nurturing and very positive. Has adorable lectures and good knowledge of French Culture. Ask questions during class about assignments if your unsure that way you won't miss any hidden assignments. 
Dont buy the physical copy of the textbook, the online version is just fine. Poindexter is very easy going and makes beginner French fun to learn
It's a fairly easy class except it can be stressful because this syllabus and assignments are not straightforward. The professor doesn't really answer to emails so you have to catch her right after class. Her lectures are entertaining and for anyone that is passionate about learning French you will love her take on French culture.
I took Madame Poindexters class over winter session and I highly recommend! She is super sweet and encouraging and it was great learning from someone who lived in France and knows the culture. Theres an easy presentation at the end of the semester and we moved through material quickly, but she was always willing to answer questions.
Added her class a week into the semester. Zoom link on canvas/syllabus took me to an empty room (even after 20 minutes). Marked absent, so not sure where I was supposed to go. Never responded to emails about attendance or homework, so I dropped the class to avoid an F. She's probably great in-person, but I wasted $200 that semester.
She's really sweet and, but the class is chaotic. We never follow the syllabus and sometimes assignments are posted without her saying anything, but as long as you check canvas regularly you should be fine. I would definitely recommend her for any French class because she's super understanding and doesn't make you feel guilty about wrong answers.
Madame Poindexter is great. She isn't a great grader, and doesn't give a lot of feedback on your quizzes or writing assignments. However, if you pay attention to the readings and lectures, this class is an easy A. Make sure you get the textbook, she uses it every class. Don't bother emailing though, she will forget or not respond.
Flora was such an amazing Professor. She cares so much about her students and it really shows. She is very understanding and a fantastic woman. The only thing is that she is quite literally impossible to access outside of class. She never responds to emails. But this was still the best class despite that. Highly recommend any class with her.
This class was fine. There were a few group projects throughout the semester in addition to many small assignments. She was a fine teacher, but honestly not great at communicating. Assignments would just.. appear on Canvas with no annoucement or mention in class sometimes. She's good though, super nice!
Poindexter was great. Never took French before but she makes the course easy and is always willing to help. Show up to class and pay attention and the homework will be a breeze. Attendance counts towards your grade but you do get four excused abscences. Very flexible and kind.
Flora is a great professor, she is super accessible outside class and very flexible with making up missed assignments, exams, and compositions. She is a fair grader and wants to see her students do well.
Take if you need a language as a requirement, as I ended with a B- and never knew what she was saying. Her class consists of mandatory attendance, easy online homework, few written homeworks, 3 exams, a project, and an oral final out of class. pretty easy but never really explained what we were learning in class so never get much out of this class
She is a really nice teacher. I love my class. It is easy to get a good grade in her class. I haven't take class before, so French is hard for me. She is helpful.
She is so sweet and I'm very glad I got her as my professor for fren since I'm just taking this as a language requirement, I love my class. Tests get harder and harder. Attendance mandatory. Very bad at putting in grades, mistakes a lot of grades and it'll take weeks of asking her to fix it before she does which can be very annoying.
Poindexter is super sweet, she makes this class really easy. I took french in high school so it was an easy A but it would be easy if you've never taken french before either. Make sure you get a textbook, you'll need it. All homework is online and easily done in 10 minutes.
Flora is the sweetest lady. I haven't taken french before but I found it to be pretty easy with her. She's a native speaker so she also fills you in on proper french culture which is really cool and her quizzes are very straight forward. You should participate in class; it'll really help you on the exams and with pronunciation.
She was a kind professor. I took this class over winter, so the material was condensed. We had a partner presentation, one oral exam, two written exams, and weekly quizzes. There were also in-class assignments. Attendance is mandatory, at least for winter session. She wanted me to succeed.
liked her as a teacher, but she needs to realize this is 105, not a 200 level class. basically from the beginning starts speaking in almost all french, because thats her first language.  for first time french students that is hard bc she doesnt translate what shes saying back to english.
Such a nice woman and is super passionate about her work! You don't have to submit the online homework on time but make sure it is done before each test (thats when she grades the hw). Participate and come to class because she assigns group assignments that can improve your grade.
Prof. Poindexter is very nice and understanding. There is very little assigned homework (online Heinle). As long as you study the vocab on your own, you can get a good grade. Often she will have graded classwork (10pts), especially when attendance is low, so come to class. The exams aren't bad, and the oral exam was easy. Take this class!",She is super sweet and encouraging and it was great learning from someone who lived in France and knows the culture. She cares so much about her students and it really shows. She is very understanding and a fantastic woman.
490,"take notes, and pay attention to lectures.
It was absolute pleasure to take Prof. K's class. Enjoyed Computer vision, will choose this career path. Lots of work in this class.
This is an outstanding course on Computer vision. Lecture heavy and has advanced concepts but covers introductory material.
Take this class but be ready for lots of work especially at the end of the semester. 
This is a great class with math and programming involved. One of the best at ud if you like this field.
To the benefit of new students, my recommendation is to attend every lecture and take notes.
The students will benefit from the lectures. If you miss them, better read them online right away. I am now interested in advanced study in this area.
I took this class in the Fall of last year and recommended my friends to take it this year. It was a pleasure to be in this class. The material was so interesting, and now I am pursuing my career in the field of Computer Vision.
He expects the students to have a deep understanding of the topics before taking this course. The professor doesnt cover information clearly and expects his students to understand everything. The material we are required to know for exams is completely unclear. Dont take this course if you have friends or family or if you plan on enjoying life.
Each week has a HW, and you can't do them if you miss a lecture. So get ready to work hard for the class. On the plus side, the instructor is giving you what is needed to get a good grade. Just attend all the lectures. Class is hard.
This class is for students with math background and solid programming. One of the best classes I took at UD. I wish professor followed a textbook more often.
Chandra is empathetic inside and outside the classroom. Go take it.
I do understand Computer Vision better now, but Chandra is wildly inefficient in ""teaching"". He never explains anything in layman terms or matter-of-fact, he's always using abstract matrix algebra. He assumes that some topics are so easy to understand that he doesn't explain them, and ironically, become the hardest parts to teach yourself.
Had for computer vision. HORRIBLE class and professor. The best I can describe the whole experience was chaos. If you ask a question, he lingers mid sentence and moves on. Instructions are not clear for anything. Homework is easy at least, however projects feel totally impossible. I would not want my worst enemy to take this class or professor.
I've taken many classes at UD, but this is the only one that's been a complete trainwreck. I have a bit of empathy because covid, but lectures are disorganized and assignments are unclear. The timelines are aggressive, we had a midterm followed by a homework and programming assignment all due within 5 days, only plus being deadlines are flexible
I took his computer vision class because I was very interested in the subject, but I did not get what I expect from the class. Lectures were very disorganized, he will keep jumping between slides, project are easy to do if you are good in programing. Exams are very tough, plus he will curve down grades if too many people did good in the class.
Chandra is one of the worst professors to take a fundamental class with. He is completely disorganized and extremely missy. He will assign homework and project without any instruction and expect you know know what to do. He will examen you in concepts that he never thought before. If you want to have a semester full of confusion take his class.
Never answers e-mail, tough grade, curve down grades. The assignments are not heavy, but he expects you to do more than he assigned. The exams are awful. Extremely disorganized.
I took computer vision class. - Had to study from text books, online videos to understand the concepts - Prof is very helpful, accessible outside class. Just drop at his office!  - Get ready for doing lots of programming. Pretty cool stuff.  - Review his slides, you will be good in exams. Not a tough grader at all.
Will learn  a lot","Chandra is one of the worst professors to take a fundamental class with. The assignments are not heavy, but he expects you to do more than he assigned."
491,"Walker is very passionate about poetry (especially her own poetry), but she does a poor job of explaining the class expectations and is very unaccommodating when it comes to explaining things in ways so that everyone can understand them. she only has one way she's ever taught and she thinks so highly that she doesn't change, but it's confusing.
She was very self-centered on her new book tour throughout the course. She also expected students to have a background knowledge in poetry and know what she was talking about. The assignments were not too much of a hassle, and the class was extremely discussion based.
She's a nice woman but very annoying. I loved writing scripts before this class but she made it more of a hassle for me. Overall annoying teacher.
Such a nice professor, always happy and the class was enjoyable.  Tests are hard and she is a difficult grader, but she is willing to help you.  I am not very interested in poetry but I liked this class, so I would reccomend it.
She was such a sweet professor. Really loved poetry. The class is pretty easy and she truly wants everyone to do well. She was nice and funny; I enjoyed the class very much. Definitely a nice lady
Dr. Walker is a great professor.  She is a little scatter-brained and disorganized sometimes, but she's a poet.  Class is not hard especially if your into poetry and plays, it was actually a lot fun.  She says attendance is mandatory but she doesn't take role.  Take creative writing classes with her!
She's inspiring, understanding and encouraging
This lady is so cracked out but loves poetry.  By the end of the semester she will get you to love poetry too.  She's a great professor and is always interesting to listen to in lectures.  This class is pretty easy, just make sure you participate in class.
Though she's a little self absorbed (assigned her own book, talked about her theater program, etc.), she is very passionate about her work and was very insightful about both the business and creativity of poetry. Class was actually a joy to take, with most of the work being fairly relaxed (journals, writing poetry, and a short essay).
She's very nice, but we didn't agree on many things and I don't think she liked me too much. I enjoyed challenging her viewpoints in workshop, and I think I'm a better writer because of it. By disagreeing with her and ""rebelling"" in some ways, I've developed my own unique style and voice.
favoritism, but doesn't discriminate.  Class tends to be boring, but she does know her Shakespeare.  WE wasted a lot of time watching plays in the media room (AKA don't go to class that day).  Took attendance the first few weeks, then just random essays that she used for attendance.  Not tough, a lot of written work, forced to see 2 plays(w/ stubs)
i thought i was taking shakespeare but the class has been morphed into a theater class because that's clearly all she cares about.  clearly has favorites and grades completely arbitrarily. take another section.
Loves theater and loves shakespeare.  Has a rewrite policy that is nice because you can't get lower than a B- if you rewrite but sucks if you always have to rewrite.  Gives very vague writing assignments and has favorites.  Not a difficult course though.
I learned the most in this class, of any.  She's very smart and very knowledgable about Shakespeare.  She's a playwright so she focuses more on plot structure than themes...her tests are pretty hard and you NEED to know the plays like the back of your hand.  She is a fair grader and I recommend her, very interesting lectures, very good class.
In general a nice lady, but rather out there and too absorbed with her little world of script writing. In fact, she wasted classtime everyday to tell us about her sw class. Don't take her for Shakes. if you want to actually learn about the plays, since she focuses on preformance and prefers drama majors and playwrites.
She's nice, understanding, and helpful.  Her tests can be iffy, but she'll end every friday class with ""have a good weekend and don't drink too much!""  And that just makes me laugh.
Exams are difficult if you don't take notes on what she says.  In the quote section use context to figure them out.  Other than that the class is easy.  Don't take if you don't like to participate, its 25% of the class.
She's pretty good, but kindof scatterbrained!  The way she teaches is unorganized...but if you like to participate and read aloud her's is the class you want!  Only a midterm, final, and 1 paper.  But the 'quote' part of the tests can be specific and hard!  She grades fairly specifically in general!
This teacher cannot teach! She acts like she knows everythere there is to know about script writing and yet can't even answer questions about a script she herself wrote. She only gives two tests that are really hard and specific. She is also very big on participation!
she's ok, but very scatterbrained.  her organization sucks & i get the idea that she doesn't like to work very hard.  i went to london with her & it was fairly easy, but arbitrarily difficult when she felt like it.","She's nice, understanding, and helpful. She's very smart and very knowledgable about Shakespeare. I learned so much in this class and enjoyed every minute. Go to class everyday, you'll love it. Hard work, but so worth it."
492,"Ross is one of the best professors at UD. He makes complex film theory seem so clear. He's so nice, approachable, fun and smart. He's like your cool uncle that you want to hang out with. I wish I had taken more film classes with him. Such a nice and smart man.  If you're a film concentration make sure you take him!
Ross is one of the best professors I've at UDel. I really just cannot beginning to say enough good things about him. Class was only 4 papers and he gave us extensions when he could tell we were all under stress. Class discussions are incredibly interesting and you'll never watch a film the same way again. Very helpful as well. Quite simply the man.
Ross was awesome! He enjoys film a lot and really enjoys teaching about it. 1 paper, 2 tests, and 3 short film projects, which were really fun to make. Test were a little bit hard, mostly because he gives so much information during class and can't fit all of it on an exam, so it is hard to figure out what is and is not going to be on the test.
Ross is a very interesting guy. He's funny and makes his lectures entertaining. I loved watching the great films that he showed once a week (meets separately from class) and he opened my eyes to the actual techniques used in filming. However, his tests were difficult, vague, and there were few opportunities to raise your grade.
Fantastic Professor, really opened my eyes to classic films like Casablanca and Rebel without a Cause. Take him if you can, he is awesome and a hell of a Professor.
Had Ross for 3 film classes- 317, 318, and 417. Unfortunately he only taught for half of the semester for 417 as he had health problems. Great professor and great lecturer. Every class is entertaining and you always leave with new information. Assignments are 2 papers (option to write a 2nd paper or double the 1st paper grade) and 2 tests.
Definitely take him if you get the chance.  Class was very interesting but slow at times.  Ross is hilarious which helped time go by, somewhat disorganized, but still a great prof.
Wonderful, charismatic professor.  However, don't be fooled by his charm-- his class isn't a breeze, but it's not grueling either.  I recommend him-- take a class with him, you'll have a great time.
Best teacher ever. I learned so much in this class and enjoyed every minute. Go to class everyday, you'll love it. Hard work, but so worth it.
Very knowledgable professor but not always the best with translating ideas to his students.
I've had him for three film classes, and he's fabulous. Don't be fooled into thinking his classes are easy (unless you're well schooled in Freud and Lacan), but he's hilarious and an excellent prof to have. Very helpful too, always willing to talk to students. He gets to know his students too. Also did study abroad with him-so much fun!
I took a bunch of classes with him when I was there in the mid 90's. BEST TEACHER EVER.
Ross Rocks, thats all there is to say about that.
Just take him... best prof at UDel, plain and simple... just take anything he offers.
I always looked forward to his class. if you have an opportunity to take him, do it!
Hross is amazing...his lectures are hysterical and he'll make you actually want to write stories.
He is awesome, take anything he teaches.
Without a doubt the best prof I've had so far. Hysterical lectures and overall just a great guy. Class isn't hard, just follow his tips for writing, and there really is no need to buy the books.
best prof. ive ever taken. course work is difficult to understand, but he walks you through it. great guy, great sense of humor, time in class flies by. don't really need to buy the books, since he covers it all in class. be ready to work.",Ross is one of the best professors at UD.

493,"Sweetest/cutest professor ever. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Really cares about his students and wants everyone to do well.
One of the best professors at UD.  I studied abroad with him and it was the most amazing abroad experience I had at US (I went on 3 different trips so I had a lot to compare).  Truly cares about his students.
Professor Arena is very passionate and very educated about what he teaches. He will sometimes repeat points and tell stories, but they are all in good intention and help foster understanding. He is very sweet and truly wants all of his students to succeed in his class.
Dr. Arena could be possibly be the worst professor ive ever had. The guy honestly is the most arrogant human being i have ever met. His lesson's that he is suppose to be teaching are never taught. He just sounds like an unintelligent old man when he lectures. If you can, dont take his class!!
I completely enjoyed my semester is his class... he kept lectures interesting and entertaining. one of the most adorable people ever. contrary to what others are saying, i had very little issue with my TA. english wasn't her first language, but she spoke it certainly well enough to convey information. awesome professor; definitely take him.
He's a sweet old man but not a very good teacher.  Easy A anyway since the tests are so simple and in groups!  If you get a good TA I suppose it could be a good class, but all the TAs in our class were awful.
Sweetest man ever!  He's an awesome professor and study abroad coordinator.  Italy is an AMAZING study abroad.
Amazing professor!! Classes are fun. Dr Arena and his wife are awesome.  If you want to study abroad in Italy - definately go with him he knows everything!
Amazing professor and wonderful, sweet guy. Definitely study abroad with him. He's simply the best!!
Dr. Arena is such a nice man, so sweet, and very easy to talk to.    And I must say, one hot pepper! and that goes for his wife too! :)
Even many years after graduating, I remember this man and what I learned in his classes. I refer to him constantly in my work.
Awesome teacher and a great guy.  Made my study abroad experience so much more enjoyable.  One could not ask for a better teacher.
Easy A!
never met someone who didn't love this man... wonderful for study abroad.. we all called him Dad!!
Great teacher.  I enjoyed taking his class.
The best teacher to study abroad with. Became more of a friend than a professor. Classes are sooo easy.The greatest teacher...esp to study abroad with. He makes everything amazing!
took his testing class. It's easy and he had easy exams.
The best professor I have ever had.  He is a great man, very helpful, and he keeps his lectures exciting.
Great professor, fun and interesting class, but too bad he retired...
Good Professor dont need to go to lectures.  Horrible TAs dont buy the book!",Professor Arena is very passionate and very educated about what he teaches. One of the most adorable people ever. I remember this man and what I learned in his classes. I refer to him constantly in my work.
494,"Loved his personality, but he was a really bad professor. His syllabus was super disorganized, his ""lectures"" were YouTube videos that he didn't even make, and he would take off points for literally everything. This class was the hardest class I've ever taken, and it definitely didn't need to be that way. Take someone else for the sake of your GPA.
On Day one, the first thing out of his mouth was telling us that we were going to get him sick because we are 'promiscuous' and 'irresponsible' college kids. Says bad reviews came from bitter students who weren't smart enough to pass his class. He has a hard time being concise. He pushes his political bias on the class/ belittles anyone to disagree
He's nice at first but makes for a mess of a professor. If you ask him Qs he will go down a rabbit hole and not answer what you're asking. He does not make an effort to prepare students for his quizzes/papers/exams. He lazily relies on 1 semester-long group project where you're stuck at the level of the lowest achiever with no way out. avoid
Nice person, terrible professor. I have never been more confused in my LIFE. I  honestly think that if I had gotten a better professor I'd probably be doing a lot better in his class right now. He does give good feedback, but only sometimes. Other times it might just confuse you even more to ask for help. I'm sorry if you end up with him tbh...
He's very rude and condescending. Only a month into class and he assumed I was cheating on everything even though I sent numerous emails asking for help. Confusing asl. Does not outline what he wants from you nor does he think he does anything wrong. Sent me to the chairperson only for the counselor and chairperson to be on my side. Avoid him.
He's a nice guy, but he grades SO hard. Out of the entire semester I got 100% on only one minor assignment. Unclear instructions, confusing, changes the syllabus constantly, and has no confidence in students. Entire class struggled because he explained nothing. Worked our behinds off and got a C+ on the final paper. DO NOT take him. 
Please avoid this prof at all costs. I have never been so lost and confused in a class before. Nothing is organized. This class is tough in general and he makes it SO much worse. Big group project with unclear feedback. Quizzes and homework assignments are terrible. You will want to cry if you take him for any class. Do not take him. AVOID!!!!!!!!!
If you like clear instructions and feedback dont take this professor. Hes the epitome of a nice guy but a godawful professor. Ridiculously though grader for giving no explanation on what he wants. He changed the syllabus maybe three or four times during the semester and rarely updated the class on these changes. If you get a bad group, good luck
If I had the option to retake this class, I wouldn't pick him again. The course content itself is extremely unclear and he doesn't seem to know what he wants. Changed the syllabus halfway through the semester and grades very heavily without giving you an explanation of what you did wrong. He's a nice guy, but he's not a great teacher by any means.
Lectures didn't make any sense, whenever I asked for help he would be condescending, and when I had a group they excluded me and I emailed him about it and he did not care. He is the worst professor and I wish I held off on taking this class instead of experiencing this.
He gives good feedback via email but sometimes takes a little while to answer. he does genuinely care about his students. The setup of BB was confusing. Tests are mc and essays. There's also a group project and some quizzes. You definitely have to put in your best effort to the class, but it wasn't super difficult. He is such a kind-hearted guy!
He seems like a nice guy but it seems as if he does not want his students to do well in his class. We just completed an assignment that gave very little instruction, and I learned a majority of what was expected by watching videos from his office hour sessions with other students. Did not give any feedback on what we did wrong for the assignment.
This is an honest review. He is very nice, very willing to help if you show him you care a little, but is very unclear in his assignments, papers, and sometimes even exams. Its hard to understand what he wants from you, that being being said he is more then willing to help vis zoom or email. Very frustrating class to be in tho...
Very unclear what this guy wants from you in practically every area of this class, especially assignments. No where is it written in words what he wants/expects from you on assignments. Tough.
he is a super nice guy, but the class was overall kind of confusing. the setup of the class was also confusing. he is very much willing to help you or answer questions, but this was my most confusing/hardest class this sem.
DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE HIM! He is passive-aggressive in person and over email. He never provides clear instructions and assumes you know what he wants for every assignment. He talked about sensitive topics during class instead of the actual material. It is clear he only cares about his paycheck and not his student's success. Very egotistical.
He will grade you VERY toughly and you will never receive in written words anywhere of what he expects in each project. You will not receive feedback on anything even if marked down. Does not teach what you are expected to learn from this class. AVOID at all costs. The one positive is that he will respond to all emails promptly and is accessible.
At first I liked him. However, his teaching and grading style is awful. He DOES NOT do study guides, and study guides would be helpful bc there are so many readings that it's impossible to know what will be on the test/quiz. He expects you to know every detail. He is also passive aggressive in his emails. Never had so many issues with a prof.
One thing I need you to understand about Dr. Henderson-King is that he relies heavily on lectures and could go on for hours. He often trails away from the subject to the point where I lose focus, but at least he keeps the discussion somewhat entertaining. I couldnt ever figure out what he wanted from me in the papers though. Also, do the reading.
He's super cool. He changes his mind on what he wants constantly and is NOT organized. We wasted like 3 weeks before the exam rambling about nothing. The group project is typical of any group project. My advice if you take this class, get a head start on collecting and interpreting your data. You have to make up for his scatteredness.","He's nice at first but makes for a mess of a professor. I have never been more confused in my LIFE.

496,"I have been teaching 27 years and have never come across anyone as obnoxious, I vowed that I would never make my students feel as inadequate as he made me feel.
not easy and wasn't sure while i was taking classes but now that i am working i realize how much he taught me and how lucky i was to have him as a teacher
Classes were terrible, as both he and the material were very difficult to understand. Was not at all helpful as an academic advisor. Contradiction - His practicum courses in the summer were fun!
Very difficult to understand. Not very well organized.  Not clear in any explanations.  I don't recomend taking him.
worst ever had do not take
Grades are arbitrarily assigned, as are test questions. He uses videos a lot in class, which is where most of the learning comes from...definitely not from him alone!! I would not recommend this professor unless you are a VERY active participant
HAD TO WORK HARD BUT IT WAS WORTH IT -- LEARNED SO MUCH MORE THAN IN OTHER CLASSES
hard but really nice and you will learn a lot
AWFUL! Can't understand him and doesn't make anything clear.
AWFUL
confusing and gives no help
very bad teacher!!!!",He is very bad teacher. You have to work very hard. Don't take this class.
497,"As my final German professor, Professor Busch made for a good sendoff. I really enjoyed how well she connected German culture to the vocab/grammatical content of the class. She clearly wants all students to succeed and keeps the class very organized (as any German professor should!).
Professor Busch was intimidating when I first met her. I soon realized  she is also a super caring person with a great sense of humor and makes learning german fun. fun? yes fun. Really stuck out compared to other classes. There is daily easy homework and lots of participating which seems scary at first, but you will speak german in no time!
Frau Busch might just be one of the best professors at UD. Grades super leniently, gives fast/detailed feedback, cares about everyone's knowledge of the course material, calling on individuals to answer questions in German, which helps greatly with the learning experience. If you need to take a language course take GRMN with her without hesitation.
Iris Busch has a very positive reputation on campus, and rightfully so. I'm glad I got to take my German classes with her before she retires. She is very caring and does a great job at integrating the culture into the language. I'm glad I'll have her for GRMN106!
Frau Busch is great! Such a caring professor, and a great teacher all around. I'm happy to say she will be my professor again in Spring! Be sure to participate in class and do your homework!
Shes so dedicated to her work. And makes class not boring at all. Especially for people who had never taken German, having a Professorin like her is just like too good to be true. Danke schön!
Really great professor for introductory German. She will make sure you understand everything and is a really caring and authentic person!
She is an amazing German professor and really engaging and funny. She isn't a tough grader, and even though there is homework every day, it is a max of 30 minutes. For the 2 papers we wrote, she allowed us to rewrite them for extra points.
She teaches German so nicely and makes it easy for you to understand. She gets that learning a new language is hard there for encourages group conversations and questions. She is passionate about her job and cares for the students. She is also hilarious, always trying to make us laugh and keep things interesting.
Hands down best foreign language professor at UD. She keeps every class full of energy and always helps whenever anyone is struggling. Highly recommended
Frau Busch ist wunderbar!
Frau Bush is the most amazing professor at UD. She is so helpful and wants you to succeed. She allows re-writes for everything and won't let you fail her class. I would 10/10 100% recommend.
Frau Busch is by far my favorite teacher at Udel. She is very fair about attendance and grades; allowing 4 days off and always allows rewrites on essays and prompts to bump your grade. She is also very very helpful and ambitious towards teaching German. She excels at communicating that enjoyment of speaking german with the students. So much fun!
you get 4 classes you can miss.  goes a little faster than a expected, but definitely an easy B if you pay attention whatsoever.  wouldnt call it an easy A however.  theres homework every night but she never really checks it.  speaking and writing assignments can help even out poor quiz grades you may get
She is great teacher and I would recommend her to anyone interested in taking German..She is so nice and helpful...best foreign language teacher I have ever had.
Frau Busch is a great professor. Like all of the other comments, she is a helpful professor, cares about her students, makes the material easier to learn, and is very passionate about what she does. Her class is a lot of fun and a pleasure to go to. I look forward to going to German every week!
Very freindly and helpful just stick to the syllabus and ur good
Frau Busch is one of the most caring teachers I have ever had. She is a native speaker, so she understands the language very well but also is very good at English. She makes class fun and jokes around and really makes you enjoy taking the class. Homework is daily, but is helpful. 5 quizzes throughout the semester, easy though. Take her class!!!!
I was very skeptical at first about taking German, but after the first few days with Frau Busch that feeling was gone. Shes a great teacher. Your grade determines on how much time you put into the class. she'll guide you in the right direction and from there its really up to you.
Frau Busch is AWESOME. By far my favorite class in my first semester. Homework is a daily occurrence, but is entirely not difficult. Not many tests, but easy when they happen (same for quizzes). She sings and dances =) Projects are fun. She is a native speaker so a big plus. Really cares about her students. Study and pay attention, very easy A.","She is a great teacher.

500,"Very smart and very fair professor, lectures make class interesting, and he is very approachable in office hours.  If you go to class, do the readings, and can write a decent paper, you can get an A. I don't agree with his conservative politics but loved this class and would take him again.
very interesting professor with interesting perspectives. lectures sometimes can get boring but it is a history class. only gives 4 grades (mid term & final & 2 papers) so plenty of time to read the books he assigns which are actually interesting. tough grader, but if you try you can easily get a B. would take again
He is a brilliant man.  He digresses a lot to waste time in my opinion because there isn't enough material to cover on the topic in the time that is given and he doesn't want to look bad.  The course is very interesting and he practically gives you the test beforehand.  Fairly easy grader in my opinion.  If you like history, you'll like this class.
Apparently changed his teaching  methods because he no longer gives out the essays ahead of time for the exams. NOT an easy  A anymore. Harsh essay grader average on exams was a 75 every time. Don't take it as an easy elective.
Very interesting class, and the professor really knows his stuff. I don't think he's as easy as some of the people are saying on here, but then again I am not a history buff. I had to study a decent amount, but still got an A. He gives the essay questions in advance for the 2nd and 3rd exams, and is SUPER helpful if you go to office hours!
Extremely boring. Do not take this class if you fall asleep easily. All he does it stand in the front and lecture. Three essay tests that the TA makes up. Kind of difficult, I never knew exactly what he was looking for. Not the easy A I thought. There are a lot of notes. All he does is talk, talk, talk.
Longest serving teacher at udel he's really boring and you basically want to die while being in class because he's so dry and old he stands at the front and lectures but really knows his stuff well he's basically a genius class really isn't that hard just very dry and boring but still easy to get an A
One of the easiest classes i've taken. I've never liked history but all you have to do is take notes during his lectures and he tells you the essays on the exam. study the night before and still get an A on every test. whole grade is the 3 exams. EASY A. Just go to class
GREAT professor. If you are a student who actually wants to learn you will learn so much just by listening to him talk. He is so wise and interesting. Tests are very straightforward essays that he tells you ahead of time, and no cumulative exams. NOT just another monotonous old history teacher. Really made me like history which i have always hated.
really nice guy, definetly knows his material, has written numerous books, is a Christian, great stories,
Really nice older man, but very hard grader. Lots of reading to do.. If you like history, it's an interesting class, but not an easy A. 2 big papers, 2 exams
Horrible teacher, just rambles on and on every class. Very boring and will put you to sleep. AVOID!
I don't know why everyone says hes good, he is extremely boring in class, not useful, but his grading is fair. However his TA and other Teacher for this class, grade a little unfairly. I would not recommended this class. I thought it was going to be exciting but He really didn't make me interested in this at all.
Great Professor, no textbook used, just two books per test. Three essay tests make up your grade for the class. Professor Wolters is the best lecturer I have had, you attend class simply because you want to listen to him. The amount of information he knows without looking at notes is incredible. TAKE HIM! I will again before I  graduate.
A very cool professor. I enjoyed the court cases he talked about. And, he also delves into his long experience (no, he doesn't plan to retire anytime soon, as I asked and he told the whole class). His books are wonderful. And, most importantly, he has a historical perspective that will challenge and enlighten your own. A brilliant man. Take him.
great professor, need to attend class to do well but he always makes it interesting and often tells stories which make class even more interesting, not hard to do well if you go to class, make sure you take a class with him before he retires
read 6 novels (1 every 2 weeks).  tests (blue book) cover the two books at a time.  use what he learned in lecture to get most of the points on the essays the rest comes from the books.  the final was just a last test (same time length as the other two).  he did say mc but mainly short answer and list, but still simple if you study and now some his
The guy is a fossil, older than dirt, and has been teaching at this institution for a long time.  But he's a good man, and I liked his conservative viewpoints.  Not a hard grader either.  Recommend.
I don't like him. Study for the final for 6 hours and still fail miserably... cutting down our final to one hour nd saying we have multiple choice when its short answer and listening things is stupid.  He's a tough grader
I thought I knew US History until i listened to him. He gives an amazing and unique perspective on history. Very good class. Exams are straight foward and all essay(not as bad as it sounds). Every so often he will tell a gem of a story and relate it to history. I highly recommend professor Wolters.","Very smart and very fair professor, lectures make class interesting, and he is very approachable in office hours. Lectures sometimes can get boring but it is a history class."
502,"Definitely take Davidson for this class. He's pretty funny and if you actually pay attention its interesting. 3 test which are half notes half text. The text is actually interesting so it really isn't that bad. He also offers extra credit. Its not hard at all to get an A.
I liked this class a lot, I always went to class and took extensive notes and it made the exams easy. The textbook isn't bad you just have to know the terms. 3 exams and extra credit opportunities. He's a smart guy.
Fairly interesting stuff sometimes. Just go to class and do all the readings from the textbook the day before the exams. The exams are straight forward; its just a matter of if you read the book and went to class or not. He's a good professor who knows his stuff. You can get an A with moderate effort.
Go to class or else you'll study unnecessary information from the book. If you actually pay attention to him you'll learn a lot. I had no real interest in Sociology until I took his class. He's down to earth but don't be late for his class! He WILL call you out- with the silent treatment. Other than that TAKE HIM :) Grades based on exams,2 + Final
He is a really good professor who really knows what he is talking about. His lectures aren't really engaging, but that's impossible with a class of 200 students. If you want a pretty easy grade, take him.
AVOID THIS GUY!!!!! I am shocked that anyone could find him interesting. he is not engaging, and not most certainly not funny (although he tries to be). lectures are incredibly dull and he often goes off on tangents that you cannot follow. 3 exams: read the chapters and you should come out with B. Reread the chapters to study and you'll get an A.
Lectures are very important but not mandatory.  Grades are based on just the three exams.
Must go to every class & do all reading assignments to do well on tests. Grade is made of 3 tests (non-cumulative) and thats it. Prof is engaging.
his classes are comical and interesting. he does his best to gethis,points across. He led me to become a sociology minor. Take this class! It will change the way you think.
Professor Davidson is a very good professor. As long as you go to his class and read through the assigned readings, you should do well in this class. His tests are fair and the questions will be familiar if you do what is asked of you. I would highly recommend taking him for this class!
LOVED his class. I liked the way he presented the information, and even though he can be monotone, he explains everything thoroughly and makes it interesting. If you go to class and take good notes, most likely can get an A.
GREAT professor. You really have to go to class in order to do well on the tests although attendance is not mandatory. If you studied, went to class and did the reading then you'll do well on the tests. He also gives extra credit which adds 6 points to one of your tests. One of my favorite professors i've ever had hands down
amazing teacher. gives so many examples and tries to make the material interesting. shows a few videos throughout the semester. 3 extra credit opportunities to add 6 pts to your final grade. tests are fairly easy but you must read the book and his notes. great guy.
Pretty easy class/teacher. He tries to make his lectures sound like they're harder than they really are. You don't need to go to class to get a good grade, just read the textbook. You also have 3 opportunities for extra-credit.
The class was very interesting. He is very easy to understand and a very good professor. The textbook was really helpful and the tests were not very hard if you study. He offers volunteer opportunities for extra points! Definitely take him!!
BEST CLASS I EVER TOOK AT UD. The material was interesting and Davidson's examples made it easy to understand. The textbook is important to read but he uses a good one so its not too bad. He is funny, smart, and helpful. This class helped me go from undeclared to a sociology major. I recommend everyone takes a class with him at one point! :)
Definitely my favorite teacher of the semester. Go to every lecture and at least skim the textbook. For 201 there are only 3 tests, the third being during finals week but it's not cumulative. You should definitely go over your notes before each test but not an exceedingly difficult class.
Good teacher, tests were not that bad. Only 3 tests for the whole year (plus a 6 point extra credit assignment). You can tell Dr. Davidson really loves what he teaches. You have to read the text book as well as take notes in class. So whether or not you show up, make sure you get the notes.
I think if I was about 40 years older, I'd marry Jeffrey Davidson. Great teacher, great classes. Papers in 348 are pretty easy, and as long as you take GOOD notes on both the books and the lectures, you'll be fine in 341. Very helpful and will go over ANY question in class. He's funny and engaging in lecture and knows his stuff. highly suggested.
i enjoyed this class, but it was difficult. definitely read the sections in the book, when he says half the exam material is directly from the book and not lectures, he isnt joking. extra credit is so easy, so definitely make sure you do it. no attendance but make sure you attend class or you wont get a good grade.","I enjoyed this class. Papers are pretty easy, and as long as you take good notes on both the books and the lectures."
503,"One of the toughest graders I have ever had. So specific about what he is looking for for the assignments, but he doesn't communicate that until after the grade is given. He expects students to know exactly what he wants us to do without telling us. 
Too strict for a course he claims to be ""not challenging"". Do not take this class for an easy A. 
Extremely harsh grader and exams are written response going into lots of detail.  Nothing is listed for assignments so I've had to guess on assignments but then the comments made on my work is nothing wrong on my part as there was no assignment description.  I'm convinced it's impossible to get a 100 on assignments. 7.5/10 or 8/10 is normal.
Professor Goodwin is a good guy at heart but takes his class and grading too seriously. I'm a PT major and in this class, we debated topics that had 0 relevance to me. In my opinion, it was a waste of my time that I could have spent studying for classes that matter to me. Spending 3 hours on hw per week to get an 8/9 out of 10 is just pointless. 
Extremely hard grader... grades like an English teacher. Have yet to receive a 100% on any homework assignment. No instructions posted for assignments, doesn't post grades and syllabus is very unclear. Very rude. 
Professor Goodwin is a kind man and I really enjoyed getting to take his class. The tests are easy if you pay attention and take notes. BHAN342 is such a cool class and he makes it really fun to learn 
He's a funny guy and interesting to listen to, but he is not organized at all. The syllabus and Canvas are never up to date and he doesn't post grades. Exams are all open ended questions but if you pay attention in class they're not hard. You get to work with kids with disabilities and there is a swimming portion but it is all manageable.
absolutely loved him! incorporated aspects from his happiness class & didn't follow univ101 curriculum to strictly which was nice, didn't make us talk about common reader, was very understanding of us & had days where we'd just have class discussions about what was going on with us was actually a breath of fresh air my freshman year & the sweetest
Attendance matters. Very straightforward guy, grades on weekly assignments.
I loved taking this class with Goodwin and being able to work with kids with disabilities. Tests are pretty straightforward as well as assignments. However, he doesn't put anything on canvas so you don't know your grade until the end of the semester and have to look at syllabus to keep track of assignments.
Not a fan of this prof. His syllabus is unclear and leaves out important info about attendance and how to submit assignment. Does not post grades to canvas so you have no clue what your grade is in the class. No computers or electronics in class. Information in his lectures are extremely outdated.
I would not take this professor again. Although the class itself wasnt hard, he has no ability to grade anything and doesnt use CANVAS, the primary form of grading at UD, so you do not know your actual grade unless you ask directly or right before the class is over! He seems too old to continue to teach unable to move with the times.
you have to go to class to pass & you're not allowed to use your computer. you have to take notes hand written & there's a swimming portion (is not that bad). definitely not my favorite prof and if you aren't paying attention he calls you out on it. class is repetitive & kind of boring
BHAN301 is definitely whatever you decide to make of it. It can be a very inspiring and uplifting course for many people, and many people in the class become very close friends. Dr. Goodwin is the perfect professor for a course such as this as he really cares about each and every one of his students. I recommend 301 to any graduating seniors.
Hes a really nice guy but the way he grades homework is actually ridiculous. he grades it like an english class and based on his own opinions. i havent gotten a 100 on a hw all year which is out of either 3 or 10 pts. he took 10 points off some girls final grade for having her phone out and said calculating our midterms was a waste of his time
This course was a history class about The Modern Olympic Games and Dr. Goodwin definitely knows his stuff. He also had guest speakers for some classes including an Olympic Champion. The material itself is not too difficult, however the exams are entirely free response, so you really need to pay attention and study, but this was my favorite class.
Professor Goodwin was a godsend for UNIV 101. He is such a great guy and really gives freshman a beacon of hope from as a staff member. He is super funny and does some pretty great magic tricks in class. Our UNIV class didn't use the common reader at all and we were only graded on small projects that took little to no effort. Would highly recommend
My favorite teacher at UD. Feels like an uncle to me. Really cool guy and super caring. Nothing but respect for him.
His class was suppose to be a fun learning class to work with kids which it was but he was such an odd grader. He never posted grades or kept track of grades so you don't even know how to fight your grade. He gave me a whole two letter grades below what I originally got and I had to call his advisor. I still think I did better then what he gave me.
Good professor for sure
I got A's on every assignment and test but ended with a grade that did not represent that because I missed four classes out of the entire semester. Goodwin just likes to hear himself talk and his classes lectures get off topic every class. The material is extremely easy, but he is so unclear about assignments, I dreaded this class.",He's a really nice guy but the way he grades homework is actually ridiculous.  He never posted grades or kept track of grades so you don't even know how to fight your grade.
504,"He is the best
The material for this class would not be bad if you took both pre calc and stat in high school but if you haven't it can be very hard. Class is a joke so most people just didn't go unless exams were being handed back. The material isn't horrible but if you're basically on your own. Ciro is super nice however and you can go to him.
Such a cute old man, but he doesn't teach. He never has a lesson planned, during class you just work on the WebAssign homework while he sits at the front and waits for questions. Don't need to attend class. As long as you do all of the WebAssigns and do decent on them you will pass the class. Good luck teaching yourself
really cute old man!! but yeah he doesn't really teach too much but will definitely help you if you ask him questions in class/office hours. Dropped the lowest test grade 3
He is the cutest old man ever and he's so funny! He really doesn't teach the material but your homework is webassigns which he lets you do in class and if you have any questions he is always happy to answer it. The course is basic stat and algebra so honestly it shouldn't be that hard anyway. Just find a friend to study with and you'll be fine!
Im so disappointed with professor Ciro and this math course. I expected an easy course and a good professor after reading his reviews. DO NOT TAKE. He does not teach which basically sets you up for failure on the exams. He would do 1-2 problems per class then it was up to you to teach yourself. He gives no resources and has given up on teaching.
He's really nice and tries to be funny but he was very hard to understand. It got better as the class went on but still somewhat difficult. Also, he doesn't teach anything, you basically just go to class to work on the Webassign homework. His grading scale is also somewhat lenient as well. I also found his 3 exams to be somewhat tricky as well. 
THE CUTEST LITTLE MAN. Doesn't explain problems very well, so make some friends! Tests are not hard and he gives practice tests which are the same. Get a study group together and you'll be fine. If you go to him for one on one help he usually clears things up! Some people complain he doesn't teach, but the math is SO basic 12 year olds could do it
Professor Ciro is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He is hard to understand and teaches 2 problems a class then makes you work on homework. He does not give study guides and never tells you information that you could potentially see on a test. He makes an easy math hard. Take someone else. Im probably going to get a C and Im an A student.
Easy algebra course, never went to class and still got  a good grade.  Webassigns every week and three midterms and a final. If your final grade is higher than your lowest midterm grade, the midterm grade will match your final exam grade. He takes attendance but does not grade it. 
Took him for Math114 and after only having 80% on my webassigns, I ended up getting an A-. The tests are easy, and you generally only show up to class to get help with webassigns. 
Professor Ciro is the cutest little Italian man. He is so nice but extremely hard to understand. It gets better as the semester goes on but he needs to learn better English. He barely teaches the class so exams can be annoying. If you ask for help he is happy to help. He loves his students. Sometimes he takes attendance.
easy class but if you do not know the quadratic formula good luck
Just show up for tests and do webassign homework every so often and itll be an easy class
Retook calc with him over winter. He's awesome and by far the easiest of any calc teacher. If you can't pass calc with him, you wont pass calc at UD.
Took calc over winter session, attendance not mandatory, do HW assigned, takes problems directly from HW and places on exams. exams only 20 questions each , final is 25 multiple choice and extremely easy. Just do Hw and ask questions in class, he is very helpful. recommend taking this class over winter.
Took MATH221 over winter session with Professor Ciro. He is very clear and straightforward as to what u need to do to succeed in  class. Go to every class, and do the homework!! He takes homework problems and puts them on the exam. 2 tests, and a final. 20 problems on 2 and 25 on the final. He replaces your lowest grade with final grade if higher.
He is the sweetest and funniest little Italian man you will ever meet, but not a good professor. The tests are somehow way harder than you think- it's such easy math but everyone tanks the tests. Plan to teach yourself the entire course- you won't understand/stay awake for a thing he's talking about.
Ciro was very nice but he was an awful teacher. He has an extremely thick accent which made his class hard to understand. He was not helpful during office hours and his exams are nothing like the practice tests he provides. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM.
Hes a great guy but an awful teacher. i had to spend a lot of time teaching myself. He knows his math but he jumps around a lot. He is hard to follow and his thick italian accent is hard to understand.",He's a funny and sweet man but test is very hard.
505,"Barlow is amazing! One of the best professors I've ever had. He really knows what he's talking about, and seems to really care about how his students do. There are only 4 grades, so it can be tough if you do poorly on one. And the class requires a whole lot of memorization. But over all, a great professor and a great class.
hesc 220 is generally going to be somewhat difficult, but barlow makes it very interesting! as long as you take good notes and follow the study guide you will be fine. requires a lot of studying but thats just due to the course. definately take it with barlow!
Absolutely Amazing. Best professor on this campus. TAKE BARLOW!   If you study for an hour before each exam and are mildly intelligent than you should have no problem with getting atleast a B.  TAKE BARLOW!
One of the most elite teachers.  He has the most interesting class, hands down.  You won't be disappointed with him.
i LOVED this class! its hard, but u learn so much. he is such a great prof, and he really loves anatomy. go to class, study the book and notes, and you will do fine. do not skip, you will definitely fall behind.
Class is hard and has a lot of notes but overll he is a nice guy. Study hard for the tests and know the book and his notes, and you'll be fine.
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS... worst professor ever, absolutley IMPOSSIBLE tests.  wait until winter session to take it.
Nice guy, but class is extrememly hard...exams are impossible!  He wants u to memorize the whole book and body!!!...if you have to take kinesiology, dont take it with him, or you will have no life!!!...He is good for hesc 220, but bad for hesc 350
He is so boring...do not take him 8am...and his exams are very hard.
I took this class over winter session, and the professor is really nice and helpful but it was alot of material in a very short period of time, and u have to know alot of details. Pop Quizzes every week, so u have to attend class. But overall i think it was a good class to take.
This professor is the worst EVER.  Voice is very monotone and tests are insane.  Never take him, look and wait for another professor.
Take this course during winter session or when your course work is light. He expects you to memorize everything in the book and you better know every single attachment, insertion, and origin of the muscles!!! He is Horrible!!
He's a great teacher. Tests have a lot of material. It's difficult to memorize everything but it was a great class.
THIS CLASS IS HARD, BUT DR. BARLOW IS THE BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE HAD. HE WILL TAKE TIME AND MEET WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE WORK. HE IS THE NICEST MAN I HAVE MET. HIS TEST ARE VERY VERY HARD THOUGH. STUDY ALOT FOR HIS CLASS AND YOU WILL BE FINE. BE
He's an amazing prof... makes sure you know whats going on.  material is not the easiest, but if you're interested in it, you'll do fine.
awsome professor, he knows his stuff. lectures are very interesting, makes you work but its worth it, you learn a lot in his class. take the hnrs section if possible, its awsome.
My favorite teacher!!  The material isnt simple but he does a great job teaching
He knows his stuff and does an excellent job helping students understand.",This professor is the worst ever. Lecture is very boring because of his voice.
506,"So hard to follow, speaks his own language. I was more focused on trying to figure out what he was saying more than the actual lecture. Avoid this class.
Seems to think he is some type of actor putting on a performance. His lectures are impossible to follow and he is rude to students. If you want to have a good semester, avoid this guy. 
I took this to fill the history breadth but it was horrible. There were few assignments so we had two papers that made up the majority of our grade. Lectures were hard to follow, he was vague with everything and then got mad when students asked for clarification. He locked canvas grades and so no one knew their grade until end of sem.
Where to even begin with this guy... His class is all lectures and readings that aren't important at all. This class had only four essays. That is your entire grade. His lectures are incredibly difficult to hear, understand, take notes on, and pay attention to. His slides do not help at all. This is the hardest class to take notes on. 
I liked Prof Montaño quite a bit. Every class was a lecture, and everything moved quickly (we did cover a few thousand years after all), but he made the lectures interesting particularly through his sense of humor. The only big problem I had was that he was definitely not tech savvy which was problematic for an online semester.
I loved Professor Montano! He's funny and tries to make the coursework interesting. Grade comprised of four items: two exams, one take-home exam, and one paper. He is an easy grader, he is looking for what you know, not what you dont know.
The class itself is not difficult. What makes it difficult is his lecturing. You never know what he's talking about. The man talks far too quickly and frequently gets off topic.
Dr. Montaño is cool and you can tell he loves English history, but the problem is 99% of the time I have no idea what he's talking about. His lectures move at a million miles an hour and he constantly tries act like a standup comic, but when his jokes fall flat it only leaves us confused. Easy enough tests and essays, but there's better options
Prof Montano is nice, passionate guy but his class... Attendance is mandatory and his lectures go in a million different directions and dont make sense if you dont understand the language of montanese. 10 weekly quizzes which are hard and 1 midterm essay and 1 take home essay. If you dont wanna read the textbook to learn, dont take this class
impossible to take notes because he talks at 100 mph and is usually talking complete gibberish. no power points, no laptops aloud. also everything he teaches specificaly concerning his early english history class hist 374 is not in order when spoken about in class. he jumps around from event to event and always mentions useless facts.
GO ABROAD WITH HIM! enjoy your time off getting credit and being able to explore ireland or london! the best! what an abroad trip should be :)
100% go abroad with him if you can. Chilliest prof ever
Amazing lecturer, exactly what you'd expect from a graduate school professor, engaging, loves his topic and makes the information come alive.
He is a great teacher ! Take him for any math. I strongly recommend him.
Montano is hilarious, takes attendance but if you know someone in the class they can sign you in. As long as you either pay attention in class OR do the reading you'll be fine. Weekly online quizzes were sort of annoying but only one exam and two essays which were graded by the TA. As long as you put a little bit of work in you'll be fine.
Absolutely the worst decision I've made at UD so far was to take a class with him. Most arrogant teacher I've ever met. Loves to ramble on and try and be funny during class. If attendance didn't count for your grade you wouldn't need to go because nothing he says makes sense anyways. Very unpleased with this ""professor""
Once you learn to speak MontaÃ±ese his lectures become much easier to follow. There were two map tests that only an idiot wouldn't pass. There were weekly online quizzes that were fairly tough, but they don't count for much. The first written exam was super easy. The second paper was 6-8 pgs, and the final is two short papers. Nothing was too hard. 
he isn't very clear on what he wants all the time so you'll need to go to office hours for a better explanation. beyond that, if you just show up and take decent notes, you should have an easy A on all papers and exams. you can clearly tell that he is passionate about his topic and his field cause he gets excited about everything!
If you find yourself in the arrogant individual's class, find the eject button immediately.  Do not take any of his classes.  He is not a good teacher.  He seems to be an individual that is frustrated with his job and he likes to take it out on students.  He was unclear about many items in class.  It was just a horrible experience overall. 
Oh my god, never dealt with such a arrogant human being in my life, avoid at all cost..",he isn't very clear on what he wants all the time so you'll need to go to office hours for a better explanation. Absolutely the worst decision I've made at UD so far was to take a class with him. Most arrogant teacher I've ever met.
508,"HE IS AWFUL! do not take his class
Don't get me wrong, he's a great guy, but some are just not meant to teach. He is clearly an intelligent man and incredibly sweet but he is so disorganized, not to mention that his accent makes it almost impossible to understand him on the rare chance that he even gives a lecture. Most classes you work w/ groups, so hope your table is smart!!
Mwerinde is EXTREMELY hard to understand. He often makes mistakes during class when showing us how to do problems and loses his train of thought. There have been so many times where someone in my class has had to correct him. His tests are pretty hard, however one upside is that he does add on extra points to our tests if we attend class
Worst teacher I have ever had at UD. He is completely unclear. doesn't spend enough time on information. he doesn't know what he is teaching. I can't understand what he's saying. he is condescending. he doesn't respond to emails. he doesn't put up practice tests/study guides. everything is out of order. without a doubt the worst class ever.
He is not clear in explaining the course material, and it makes the class frustrating. MyMathLab will become your best friend. He has office hours and you can schedule time with him but do not expect him to help you.
Had him for Calc I over winter- he was regularly 15+ minutes late & had to be corrected on his math or method/formula by a student multiple times every single lecture. During the last week, we had an exam Monday, & then in class on Tuesday he announced another exam for Thursday. Also, Friday we had a cumulative final... 3 exams in 1 week
This class was so frustrating, I took prelacy in high school so the material wasn't that hard but if I had no prior knowledge about it, I would've really struggled with this professor
So Mwerinde is a nice guy, but his accent really makes this class hard.  I personally didn't understand his teaching style and would rely on classmates to help me with homework.  He often gets lost in his own problems. If can definitely try to avoid this class because you wont be prepared for the next math class
Terrible teacher. Less educated than his students. He comes to class and sits down at his desk and does not his job and teach. I want a refund for this class.
This professor is the worst professor at UD. 
His accent is very thick, i could barely understand him. He gives in class quizzes and activities that account for 20% of your grade so you need to go to class. He is often confused and looks to the class to right his wrong. Terrible teacher and not helpful at all. Seems to be a language barrier.
If you had a good calc class in highschool you'll be fine, it is all the same stuff. If you didn't you will may struggle, maybe take it somewhere else. All of the calc profs are basically the same. Tests are department wide. Accent is a little hard to understand. Nice guy. Gives back points on quizzestests. Do homework on your own, not required. 
Worst Professor I've ever had. His lectures are extremely unorganized and unclear, his accent is often too thick to understand, and he will often get confused on his own questions and require students to correct him. Prepare to teach yourself this class, because relying on his lectures for the material that will be on the test is a huge mistake.
DO NOT TAKE HIM! This class was the hardest i have taken so far. Not because of the material but because he is a horrible teacher. He rushes through the material and does not explain anything and even if you go to office hours he is worse. He is a nice guy but it is not worth the hassle.
AVOID!!! Took over winter for pre-calc. Never followed the syllabus. Would very often get confused on his own problems, only to have a student correct him. ALWAYS behind on material. We were supposed to have exams every Friday, but we wouldn't even have covered half of the material said exam was on. Rushed material in. Late responses to emails. 
literally worst prof i've ever had. first online class  biggest regret. does not answer emails, or does after like 4 followups. super tricky quizzes and annoying exams, doesnt give you feedback just a grade. no curves or anything. material would've probably been easier to learn in a normal class but online is hell. would not recommend.
Patrick Mwerinde is a great person, he is very nice and genuine. Don't let his nice appearance fool you, this professor has poor teaching. Everyday we would go over maybe 1 or 2 problems and work through them as a class, keep in mind the teacher would sometimes even have trouble with the problems and everyone is confused. I do not recommend him. 
Although he doesn't speak english very well, he just wants you to pass. If you focus in class you will realize its not a hard class at all. DO half the optional homework problems and you will get an A. Don't be lazy or you won't pass. He's really a nice guy who means well. if you ask for help or clarification he will help enormously.
IF YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN CALCULUS BEFORE DO NOT TAKE IT FOR YOUR FIRST TIME WITH MWERINDE. Really nice guy but extremely hard to understand. Most of the time he even trips himself up and you end up spending the whole class watching him do a single problem incorrectly. The TAs he chooses are just as bad so don't think they'll be able to save you.
Professor Mwerinde is a super nice guy, but he is not a good professor. He does not convey the lessons well whatsoever, a thick accent definitely acts as a language barrier, and the TA's he chooses are no better. The tests and quizzes are written by the TA's, so they are very difficult. He gets confused by his own problems too. Avoid this class.","Worst Professor I've ever had.

509,"I took this class as a pre-vet major with an extensive background in the industry. being graded by just 4 tests and the occasional homework assignment will bring down your grade. has extra credit, but it wasn't even worth doing it. changed my major partially bc of this course. the final is online tho so you can cheat ig.
I took ANFS and the class itself was fine, but the lady is very unkind. I sent her a very nice email and she shut me down saying I was better off to get points before I emailed her when she didn't want to be emailed. Very rude. 
I am upset that I decided to take this for a breadth course. As a nonmajor class, the first exam had an average of 68, which shows how hard she is making these exams. Only gives 4 exams as your grade. 
Dr. Griffiths is a very knowledgeable professor which has it's pros and cons. The good is that she explains things  in great detail with pictures, graphs, and diagrams no matter if the lecture is in person or online. The bad is that she expects you to get things lots of things done out of class so please learn to manage your time!!
Absolutely terrible. This is an online asynch 100 level class that has an average exam score of 68% on the first exam and a 67% on the second one. There are no curves at all on these. Im a senior and have had 400 level classes that have been easier than this class. Avoid at all costs.
I have never in 4 years at this school had a more insanely difficult class.  The study guides don't even have the majority of the exam questions so they are mainly a waste of time and the material covers such a broad area that you'll have to memorize all of it.
The lectures were all powerpoint videos that you had to watch and take notes on for homework and class time was used as a discussion. She clearly explained each topic in detail and gave numerous extra credit opportunities. As long as you study for her exams and take good notes it's an easy A.
Griffiths is great, she gives a lot of extra credit. You have to watch lectures and take notes but they're really interesting. Look over the information before exams and you'll do fine. Will definitely be taking another one of her courses in the future!
I took it asynchronous and each week you have to watch a few videos summing up to about 1 hr 15-30mins. She is knowledgeable about the subjects and if you watch the lectures and get a hang of the type of things she asks in her tests youll do well. She gives lots of extra credit half way through the semester. GOATED. Mostly about farm animals.
Dr. Griffiths is a very informative and clear professor. Her lectures are long, but they arent too difficult. She explains things a lot. To get an A on exams you just have to watch the lectures and take some notes. No homework. I love that she gives many extra credit opportunities that are straight forward and easy to earn. Exams are clear, easy.
In every in-class lecture, she makes sure to cover topics that students typically get confused about and answers all questions. Watching the videos is a must because some of the information in them is not found on the slides she is going over! Class will be hard if you do not prepare for exams, but even just reading over your notes really helps.
101 level classes shouldnt have 68 as the class average on the exam. She seems nice but seems to forget that the class is for non majors. Do NOT take this for easy credit. I hated this class so much it made me hate the whole university.
She is the kindest person ever. This class included a lot of information so, if you want to earn a good grade it is 100% necessary to watch lectures, take notes, and NOT CRAM. There weren't any homework's so grades relied on only 4 exams, but extra credit was offered. You will leave this class with a lot of knowledge and great study techniques.
Dr. Griffiths is a kind, knowledgable professor. Her tests were sometimes tricky but she listens to student feedback and tries to give back as many points as she can (she gave us an extra credit assignment to make up for a bad test grade). She does have a lot of lectures for each test, so make sure you keep up with watching them!
Honestly, she was a good professor in terms of she knew what she was talking about it and she was good at articulating and explaining it. She was also good with the exams and trying to give us all extra credit to balance out some of the issues with the class. I struggled with her, but that could be because I'm a POSC major taking an ANFS class.
Wouldnt suggest to anyone to fulfill breadth requirement. Besides that she gave opportunities for extra credit but to get a good grade watching the lectures, which are sometimes long, is necessary. Grade is only from 4 tests but takes your highest grade and counts it twice
took this as a easy intro breadth class for my senior year and I regret it.. the tests are so detailed and u only are graded on 4 exams and a few extra credit which really did not help. I would take it in person if u have the option.
Professor Griffiths was one of the worst professors I had my freshman year. She was rude for no reason. Her tests are harder than they have to be. If you like classes where your grade is made up of multiple things do not take this class. She only has 4 tests and that's it for your grade. Not a good choice for a breadth course.
Do yourself a favor and do not take this course online. This class would have been so much easier if it was synchronous on Zoom. There is so much information on every exam it is almost impossible to memorize all of it. There were 4 exams and one small extra credit assignment and that was it.
The class is not hard if you watch the lectures, do the study guides and attend the review sessions. Gives a reasonable amount of opportunities for extra credit. My only critique of the course is that there was not enough coverage of animal rights, which was disappointing for me personally. In any case, she's nice woman and a pretty good professor.","She is a good professor if you watch the lectures, do the study guides and attend the review sessions."
510,"Ronet is truly one of the best or maybe the best professor I had at UD. Took this class my last semester and it turned into a remote class in spring 2020. She still taught us everything we needed to know and she cared about every single student in the class. Take this class with Ronet if you have to take it!!!!
Prof. Bachman is the best for Soci301. Exams count for nearly 80%, clicker quizzes 15% and labs/final project 5%. She is so nice and goes slowly through the stats portion. Tests are easy since she goes over exact questions with you before, with just changing numbers on the exam. Labs are easy, but the group project was time consuming.
I was dreading taking SOCI301 because I am so bad at math/statistics. Professor Bachman made the material make sense. She is so helpful and nice. Attendance/ participation help your grade a lot, but its's not the end of the world if you miss a couple classes. She is the best!! If you have to take this class definitely take it with Bachman.
If you have the chance to take her do it! She is the best professor I have had here. Soci 301 can be intimidating but she practices it so much with the class, you will understand. She will go above and beyond for anyone and keep class fun and interesting!
Ronet is a awesome professor! I am a super senior at UD and she is the most helpful professor I have ever had. She cares about her students more then anything else, and will go the extra mile to see you succeed. (e.g. She will meet with you after class to tutor you individually to make sure you understand the material.) She is a must for SOCI301.
Professor Bachman is such a sweet lady. You can tell that she truly cares about each and every student and really wants you to do well. Go to class and listen to her lectures, the material is a tad difficult at first, but you will get used to it and she makes it entertaining. Shes always willing to meet outside of class. You will do well if you try
SOCI301 was one of the best classes I have ever taken.  It wasn't too much work but I learned and actually understood so much about stat...I took MATH201 before and really struggled but SOCI301 was just so much more applicable and understandable!  If you want to do any research at all in any social science, definitely, definitely take this :)
Ronet is an incredible teacher. She is patient with the class, and thorough. More importantly, she is an even better person. Goto office hours, any confusion with material she clears up there. Wonderful experience in 301 for not having stat background.
Loved this class. Surprisingly interesting material. She posts all material online and provides great study guides. Super helpful if you ask questions. Very Very nice lady and makes some funny jokes here and there too. I definitely recommend this class for a 4 credit. Lab is easy -  attendance is taken in that. She makes it fun.
Don't overthink the material. Don't buy textbook. Slides all posted online. Lab is easy. Enjoy her sense of humor. Ask for help in the middle of class because you're not the only one who's lost. Awesome teacher for a required class! And she dresses up for Halloween & brings in candy.
The best teacher I have had/ probably will ever have. She wants all of her students to pass, and will do anything to make sure of that as long as you show her some effort.
She is one of the best professors UD has to offer. She is very passionate about the material and is always willing to help those who don't understand. Class isn't  mandatory, but go anyway. She has a great sense of humor & makes class fun. I wish I could take another class with her. I was dreading this class but ended up enjoying it and doing well
Professor Bachman is the best professor for this course. She makes the material fairly easy and understandable and really wants everyone to do well. She is always willing to help outside of class as well. Definitely reccommend her
Ronet is, by far, one of the best professors I have had at UD. She makes class fun because she is very witty and kind of scatter-brained. If you take this class with anyone else you will regret it!
Ronet is great!  Breaks down stat methods so it's easy to understand.  Very willingly to help outside of class too - cares more about students learning the material than any other profs I've had.
Dr. Bachman is AMAZING! very nice woman, always willing to help. extremely approachable! take this class with her!
Ronet rocks! :)
This is a sociology course but it is all statistics and research methods, so it is far from being easy.  Bachman is very helpful and very straightforward.  Go to class regularly and you will do well.
Bachman is absolutely amazing! Do not take this class with anyone else. I heard horror stories about taking this class but with Bachman it's really not hard at all. I love her!!! Even brings her son to class occasionally, very very cute! TAKE SOCI301 WITH BACHMAN, YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID.
Dr. Bachman is an exceptional professor. She  definitely deserves to be nominated for an excellence in teaching award.  Throughout the semester, you will thanking God that you took the course with her, she is the best.",She is one of the best professors. She make the material fairly easy and understandable and really wants everyone to do well.
514,"Urbanas changed my life, let him change yours. I loved him and worked hard in his classes and did well. Use examples and insights on the written exams and you'll do well.
GREAT professor! Always enthusiastic, extremely knowledgeable. Looked forward to his class. World Religions class and he remained objective while conveying all points necessary. Taking another class with him this upcoming semester and looking forward to it. Exams require a lot of knowledge about the material, so you HAVE to STUDY!!!!!!!
This professor rocks. The class is a lot of work, but he will help you with anything you don't understand. Use examples on the tests he likes that. Take a lot of notes. Study all the questions he gives you because you can never guess the right ones he will use. I took 3 classes with him and enjoyed them. He is probably the smartest person I know.
Dr. Urbanas is amazing. He is very smart and very knowledgeable about his subject. He gives you 6 questions before each test and puts 3 of them on test. The final is take home so take the notes and you will be fine!
He is extremely knowledgeable about course content, very enthusiastic, 3 essay tests, 2 extra credit essays.  Class is hard if you don't pay attention! Taking him again next semester!
Really interesting teacher. Knows his stuff. only 3 exams, all essay exams, and one optional extra credit essay. He's very adamant about examples. Helpful through email. Not a class you can sleep through or afford missing. Information is difficult to comprehend but he does what he can to help out. Recommended.
Such a fun, enthusiastic guy! Tests are kind of hard because they are essay questions and it is a lot of material to remember, but he gives you 5 questions to study from and then picks like 3 for the exam. I don't think I would have liked this class with any other professor. Oh yeah, and he kinda talks like a california surfer guy. It's funny. :)
Very helpful and enthusiastic about the class. Very engaging teacher.
Class was tough but tests came right of your notes. You might even be able to get away with not reading the text because he's so clear. More of a descusion than a lecture. I learned so much!!!
Class was three hours and boring, he encourages class discussion but argues with you if he disagrees, have to read the book to get a good grade
Highly challenging and demanding professor. He's both fair and open, and very passionate about the subject matter. Don't take his classes if you're lazy, stupid, or expecting an easy A.
Very Interesting Person. Has a lot to bring to the class, like a book of knowledge!
Veyr hard class!!  My first philosophy class, and it was very difficult.  I worked my ass off, and I actually pass/failed the class cause I bombed the first of only 3 tests.  It is actually somewhat interestng, but you need to read,go to class, take notes, and study really hard.  Not really worth it.
Nice enough guy, but he really is boring.  He's passionate about the subject material, but you can't teach philosophy easily on an overhead.  Class wasn't as good as expected, tests were multible choice (no essay) and often weighted with tricks.  Not a lot of chance for extra credit, tough course
hard tests and cumulative final, BORINGGGGGGGGG.. you think it would be interesting but he is so boring and proper.. dont take it for a group, and DONT TAKE 3 HOUR
hard class, but a good professor.  nice guy, but unfortunately he could teach better than he does.  He puts up slides, but you have to write down more of what he says.  I'm really not sure how to do well in this class, but i liked it anyway.
lectures are a bore.no1 goes and if they do they leave early his tests are too in depth.his rvw sheet is the exact material we covered for that exam. isnt helpful out of class. xtra credit helps very lil. adds extra pts to your lowest grade be4 the final.
worst teacher ive ever had.  worst class ever.  tres boring.
Nice guy. Knows his stuff. Exams are very in-depth, you can't bluff your way thru them. Do all extra credits WELL because he grades them like an a$$. Keep up w/ readings week to week and highlight notes, then write those notes down and memorize!
Terrific teacher! Lots of hard stuff, but he taught it and wove it together well, and I DID feel much smarter after having taken the class. Lots of fun, very intelligent man.",Please don�t take this class. This class is very boring. But I feel much smarter after having taken the class.
515,"This class is challenging, but manageable.  His lectures definitely help to make sense of the material, but the book helped me the most.  In order to do well in that class, you just need to go over and over the material.  Also, he gives out old practice exams, so be sure to do them.
He's interesting and the theoretical concepts that he presents are easy enough in lecture, though the lectures don't prepare you for exams. You must do the practice problems in the book, which aren't so easy in order to at least pass. He doesn't give partial credit b/c this is the premed weed out, though not everyone was.Take to learn!
This guy is definitely over-rated. He's passionate about the subject matter, but his lectures don't really prepare you for his exams. You must do the hw problems in the book, which are very tricky. You must know the info inside or out or you'll do poorly b/c he doesn't believe in partial credit& assumes everyone in this class is going pre-med.
Great professor. Exams aren't hard as long as you study the notes. Read the book if you want but you don't NEED to. Second exam is major grade booster. Final was the easiest exam I've ever taken.
orgo is a hard subject, but schneider makes it clear what you need to know and makes it interesting with real-world examples. he is funny and knows his stuff. Z is for Zame Zide!
Even though I had to change my major because I could not get through organic, I still must say that Professor Schneider is an INCREDIBLE professor. He is extremely clear in his lectures, funny, and engaging during class. Even though it was hard, I managed to stay intruiged with everything Professor Schneider taught. Take him for organic!!!!!!!!!
I'm switching into a chem major because of him. Everyone says Organic is awful but he makes organic chem interesting. Lectures are necessary but the book basically says the same exact thing. Tests are hard but he prepares you well for them. Very funny guy. Knows his stuff and tries to get his students excited about it.
Great professor - I'm so bummed he's not teaching 322 next semester. He tells you on the first day that if you spend an hour a day on the class you'll get a good grade, and he's right - go to class, re-copy notes, read the book and do book homework and you'll be good. Makes O-Chem as painless as it can be, very funny and a great lecturer.
definitely take schneider if you have to take orgo.. the class is hard no matter who you take but he is so incredibly nice and funny.. he will make up funny examples to help you remember things and crack jokes in class..practice tests help a lot
He is the best! Take him if you can for 321 and 322 he is crystal clear and lays a great foundation in 321 for 322. Hands down my favorite chem prof ever! You do need the book as with any chem class. HE makes chem as fun as it can be
I've laughed out loud on several occasions in this class. Really funny, really smart, great teacher.
Organic chemistry is a hard subject but he explains everything so well and gets the class involved. Funny and interesting, go to class and read the book and you can do pretty well.
Best that organic chem can be
good professor but isn't really willing to throw a bone when the students need it. refused to curve exam that someone got a 0 on and the avg was a 54, but gave a whopping 5 ec points (who knows if he even gave it to us?) much harder than chem321..many many more reactions. know the textbook inside and out and you'll do fine.
Doesn't seem to understand that not everyone forced to take this class in order to graduate wants to go onto med school. Has ridiculous expectations and makes it hard to pass some of his tests. Someone got a zero on a test this semester. If you can avoid orgo, id advise avoiding it at ALL COSTS!!!
Orgo is an extrmely hard topic, but he explains it very well. He is a really good teacher. Go to class, do what he tells you to do, do the practice tests, and you'll do fine. I really recommend taking him if you need to take Orgo.
Dr. Schneider really knows how to teach organic chem and make it comprehensible. If you go to class, do the problems in the book, and rewrite your notes you can definitely get an A. He's a really funny guy too, and encouraging of everyone's progress; one-on-one he's not as supportive. Definitely take him but expect to work outside of class.
For a hard class like O-chem, he does a pretty good job explaining it.  Exams start easy and get harder, but if you study and go over old exams and notes, you should be good.  The guy also has a good sense of humor.
Any prof that can assign Caddyshack and Christmas Vacation as extra credit for the final is awesome.  Have to read book, homework, and go to class.  Hard class, but he helps you get through it with his sense of humor.
Hard but fair.  raw sex appeal out of this world.","Dr. Schneider really knows how to teach organic chem and make it comprehensible. If you go to class, do the problems in the book, and rewrite your notes you can definitely get an A. He's really funny also."
518,"One of the kindest, most honest men I have ever had the honor of sharing a conversation with. Rest in peace Charlie; you will be sorely missed.
People saying this is a terrible class are just ppl who wanted a do-nothing easy A. THIS CLASS IS EASY, you just have to care a little. I never read textbook, I never did homework, just went to all labs/disc and went thru the problems/exercises in the text (that he gives you the answers to). Exam is 90% straight from those probs. Take if you CARE
although booth can be a bit boring sometimes, i would definitely recommend this class. if you put a little time into it it's an easy A. highly recommended to read the textbook and make sure you understand the problems. this class really is not very difficult at all. tests are 10 T F 10 multiple choice and 10 problems.
I would not recommend this professor. have to read the book EXTENSIVELY because booth doesn't make any sense in lecture. This is unfortunate because the exams are mainly on the lectures that don't make sense. Very senile professor, should retire soon. Labs are pointless. He messes up spelling and equations all the time, and when i used the messed u
Teacher is a joke! He doesnt teach well but helps out well. Exams questions are chapter checkpoints.  Final is copy & paste from prev. 3 exams. Class is easy but HARD to take serious!
His lectures are unorganized and pointless to go to. His exams are random and somewhat difficult. NOT a good class.
He gives you a sample test, and really, the test has the same questions, some of them with different numbers. The final is just questions from all the tests put together Sometimes he has a hard time understanding your questions, but once he gets it, he usually explains it pretty well.
Exams test for your understanding of the concepts, not memorization of materials, so you must know your stuff. Lecture quizzes come from chapter exercises and problems so if you do them you'll be fine. Lab quizes aren't hard either since you're allowed to use a lab notebook. Overall a great professor with somewhat difficult exams for a 101 class.
Really, really, really boring...but not that hard.  you don't need to go class, it really doesn't help.  this years final was not cut and paste totally, don't be tricked.  some of the questions were the same but with numbers changed.  the labs are really easy. you can't take this class as a p/f but you only need a 54 to pass it
He was a great professor n a really nice guy. He def treated the class as if we were his grandkids. He is a really easy A-B. His final is copy n paste n even tho exams can be tricky theyre all multiple choice and theyre all curved. Just go to class n do the homework u will be fine.
I really really enjoyed his class. I barely did any of the readings but always did well on the exams and ended up with an A. I had never taken any physics or anything before. If you just go to class and pay attention you'll be fine. Prof Booth was soo nice. I loved him!
Class is boring, you really don't need to go to the lectures No one does, there not that helpful. READ on your own. With lab/disscussion you'll be fine. He curves everything even the final (and I think final grade as well) I stopped going to lecture in 6 weeks in, failled 2 exams and still got a B.
for a 101 class, this was wayy to hard.  prof booth was really nice, and even helped us in trabant when we were studying for his final, but STUDY CHECKPOINTS!!!  also: his final is completely cut/paste from the first three exams.  STUDY EM!  and going to class helps, and the readings are useful.
failed the first test miserably, but really isn't that hard if you just review class notes & checkpoints in the book--labs easy, lecture lab & discussion boring
This class involved A LOT of reading and A LOT of extra work, if you don't have the time I suggest something else.
Horrible class. The man's exams are completely based off the non-important info - he didnt test on anything important! Also the TAs were WORTHLESS, their english is horrid. Luckily half the final grade is based off of the lab and discussion, so I was able to get a B. Plan on failing the first 3 exam
not too bad a class..tests were annoying but go to lab and discussion and your guaranteed a C or higher without doing any extra work
DON'T DO IT! This class was supposed to be easy but guess what, it's not!! He's a disgruntled old man who never emails you back or answers your questions. He reminds me of Mr. Burns from the Simpsons. Anyway, his tests are way too hard and his TA's don't even speak English. Sounds like fun, huh?
He gives u ur exams on a silver platter basically The t/f ?s come straight from the checkpts in the book and the mc is off of the practice exams and the problems in the book. Labs are easy and discussion help bring up your grade if you just show up.Booth was very fair and made a lot of jokes in lect","Don't do it very horrible class. Class is boring, you really don't need to go to the lectures No one does, there not that helpful."

Dr. Steinberger leads enticing lectures that discuss the relevance of the readings to today's society. She is also one of the most kind people that you will ever meet. Her class was amazing. All you need to do is read and participate!
Dr. Steinberger is an amazing, dedicated professor! Her class was full of fun activities, and her enthusiasm for the material made it easy to get excited about too. She pushes you to do your best, but she is very approachable and patiently gives thorough feedback to help you do so. As a senior, her class was by far the best one I've taken at UD.
She is so sweet. She is always willing to explain, and corrects without being harsh. While she grades papers a bit harshly, she gives great feedback and allows you to make corrections and resubmit to gain extra points. 211 is taught almost entirely in French, but she dictates very well and speaks relatively slowly, so it's not hard to understand.
An excellent professor. She sets high expectations but only because she really wants you to learn. She creates a classroom environment based on mutual respect and strives to form positive relationships with her students.  If something proves unsuccessful, she is willing to adapt, always keeping her students best interests at heart. Go for it!
She is very friendly and helpful.  Her tests have fun essay questions and dicussions in class are always interesting.
Very enthusiastic about the course material, and tries to get everyone to participate.  She would bring in songs that went along to the poems and would play excerpts of the plays we were reading to help us to understand and appreciate it more.  I enjoyed the course even though I really dislike poetry.  Doesn't give a lot of homework.
One of the best professors EVER!  She has such a great balance of lecture and discussion, challenge and flexibility, friendliness and firmness, and she has been really trying recently to vary the types of activities and assignments.  This last class was a multi-fold experience all throughout the term.  I've taken her twice and wish I could again.
Very good professor, but a little on the tough side. Very willing to help and explain things (multiple times if necessary) and VERY understanding. Tries to get everyone to participate, which is nice. I liked her, I just wished I had payed more attention in class.
Class was interesting and pretty easy. Take good notes in class and you should be fine with quizzes and tests. She is respectful of everyone's opinion and is genuinely interested in the subject. Participate in class and class will go by much quicker.
Very nice and very patient.  She won't make anyone participate so try and say something or the class won't move at all.  Fair grader and content isn't easy but its a good course and she's a good prof.
BORING but easy
As long as you read the texts and put a little thought into analyzing it, you'll do well.  Don't pack up too early because she always gives homework at the last minute.
During my whole college career, her class I enjoyed the least.
speaks quickly and quietly, but you get used to it. do the work and participate, otherwise you'll be bored and lost. she genuinely loves the material, and class is fun if people participate. i learned a lot in her class and was challenged, but did well.
boring! she has a formula and never deviates from it.
Very quiet, class is boring but material is occasionally interesting.  Hard but fair grader.
Very nice, low-talker, but very knowledgeable and enjoyable.
you're more organized than she is, she grades inconsistently and could use a ped

528,"Dean is a very good professor if you're as passionate about the subject matter as he is; the medieval class is very centered on things like Beowulf & Dante, so be prepared to read long dramatic poetry. Group work is common & he is  extremely helpful if you approach him. He loves Arthurian legend as well, so you can't go wrong with that for a topic!
Professor Dean was terrible. I learned nothing the entire semester, other than to never take a class with him again. He plays favorites, and grades essays very critically.  If it wasn't for him taking attendance and giving pop-quizes I would have never gone.
I took this class because I needed a group A requirement and I figured it would be easy, little did I know this class would be so entertaining. The readings he picks are interesting reads, he does expect you to read them as they will be discussed in class. He's a fair grader. There were small homework assignments and three papers. Take this class!
James Dean will bore you to tears. He's really a nice guy but I'm not sure that I learned much from him, as most of the lectures were translations of Middle English and highly fragmented class discussions. Assignments were straightforward but had no logical grading scheme, and participation expectations were a little unreasonable. 
Very passionate about his subject and pretty entertaining in class, but he has a very odd thinking pattern making quizzes extremely difficult. His grading on papers also seems a little random, and sometimes harsh. Although he's nice, I wouldn't take his class again.
He's an okay guy, but he's kinda rude with his comments on papers. Also, his grading policy is a little excessive. He marks you down an entire letter grade for being late. Most professors don't take off that much. He's a nice guy and all, but I would not take him again.
Take him! Great personality, funny, genuinely cares about his students, and willing to help if your having trouble! Fair grader, good discussions, and interesting lectures! One of the best professors I've had!
Professor Dean's ability to recite hundreds of lines of poems and pieces of Medieval literature is astounding. However, his grading seemed arbitrary and he picked out little tiny flaws in every paper so the highest possible paper grade was a 95. Almost impossible to get an A, uses participation grades to ensure everyone gets an A-
Actually one of the best professors I have ever had at Delaware. Grading is tough but fair. Hilarious man who genuinely cares about teaching and wants you to do well. Take him once!
Truly amazing professor. He's the best one I've come by in all my classes. He's clear, fair, and interesting. Not to mention he obviously cares about his students and feels awful if a class gets boring. I would take ANY class he offers.
Great English professor! Was fair in grading although not super easy to get an A. Doesn't overload with reading and makes class interesting.
Really great English professor. Kept the class interesting by mixing it up between lectures, group work, discussions, and films. Grades fairly, but challenging to get an A on a paper.
I took Dean's ""Medieval Lit"" course.  it was all about King Arthur.  We explored the  history of Arthur and the myth/legend surrounding him.  Papers, no exams.  don't make grammar errors. The best thing about Dean is that he loves the topics he teaches, but he loves sharing it with others even more.  Teaching is truly his calling.  and...he's HOT!
I'm an 'A' English student, but Dean is a baffling grader. Your grades feel totally random. There's no consistency with what to expect on assignments even when you feel like you are doing consistent work. I get an 83, my friend gets a 99. Next assignment, 96 for me and 84 for him. I don't feel like getting B's for minor grammar errors/typos.
Prof. Dean is great! I have had him for three semesters in a row and his papers are interesting and usually pretty easy and the creative projects are fun. As long as you pay attention and work hard, his class should be a snap
This professor makes medieval studies hip in a way that I've not seen in any of my other medieval classes.  He often uses movies, art, and even music to spark class discussion, which nicely balances out the literature.  HIGHLY suggested!
Professor Dean is awesome. Great guy, amazing teacher, and makes class really fun. He makes it a point to get to know each student and forms a comfortable classroom relationship. Definitely loved taking classes with him!
I strongly dislike Prof Dean.  He is overly particular with his grading and he always waits too long to give you the 2pg paper assignments.  You get them monday and turn them in thursday which can be difficult when you have other classes that take up a lot of time.  He just isn't very nice and is boring.  I feel like i have not learned anything!
(I'm not sure if that's the course number.) I took Chaucer with Professor Dean. He is an excellent professor, and really makes one care about the subject. he really brings it alive, and makes class interesting. He is accomodating, and helpful. Show up, pay attention, and work hard, and you'll do fine.
So nice and helpful, and interested in the subject...Brit Lit was not my thing before this class, but somehow I ended up doing great and (gasp!) enjoying it. There is a fair amount of writing, but having taken many other English classes, I have to say his papers are on interesting topics and fun to write. Submitting work online was helpful, too.","He often uses movies, art, and even music to spark class discussion, which nicely balances out the literature."
538,"Dr. Kovarik is one of the best professors I have had the pleasure of learning from. His lectures are easygoing, not much note-taking is necessary but it is important that you pay attention to the material presented. He cares a lot about his student's success. He brings a certain ""fun"" to learning and I would 100% take his class again.
Mr. Kovarik's class was pretty easy. There was a new assignment almost every class but he does the assignment with the class so just follow along and you'll have the assignment done at the end of class. No tests of any kind. Only a few (maybe five) d2l quizzes. He also goes around the room and makes sure you understand. I'd recommend him for 226.
Kovarik knows his material however is extremely boring to listen to. His test are relevant to what he teaches however takes a lot of studying to pass. He does not explain any of the projects or homework. Everything is a trial and error process and he becomes very upset when you don't understand. I would not recommend and will not take again.
Kovarik is a one of a kind professor. His knowledge on topics of media history and the law make you wonder why he's even teaching students--he could be out there doing other things! At the end of the day he cares for what he's teaching. Although a tad on the unorganized side, he always announces what's going to be covered for the test.
He is IMPOSSIBLE to reach out of class and he's always late. He's a really nice guy but I don't think he takes his 100 level classes seriously. There's never a straight answer with this guy either and his grading standards and due dates were never clear at all. He literally changed the due dates of everything mid-semester. Would never take again.
He is the sweetest, most helpful professor a student could ask for.  Although at times he seems flustered, he never loses his positive attitude.  He genuinely cares about his students learning his content.
Bill is funny and charismatic but he spends almost every single class talking about his own work and who he knows.  He doesn't offer much guidance in semester projects and gives zero feedback on assignments. He's also very hard to get a hold of out of class  and doesn't honor office hours as scheduled. I learned very little in his class. 
This was by far the most frustrating class I have ever taken. Assignments were vague, due dates were unclear, and it was impossible to get a straight answer to any question.
I took Dr. Kovarik's Investigative journalism class. this class taught me more than all of the other classes combined. Dr. Kovarik knows his material and taught a practical skills class. few other professors were willing to lower them selves fromthe lofty theoretical hights they live in. take this class!
kovarik----the MAN.  you don't bs this class, but if you show up he will GIVE the answers and you will LEARN
Professor Kovarick is a great professor and has a lot of interesting information and experiences that he is eager to share with the class which is great, but we normally got off topic.  He wasn't very good at responding to e-mails and after taking an online class with him this became frustrating.  Assignment guidelines were very unclear too.
Little to no help with assignments, no reply through e-mail, constantly arrives late, & blows off anyone with questions after class. I was lost from the beginning because the concept of law baffles me. He didn't make it any easier. Nice guy and all (and funny), but as a professor he's not getting  a high rating from me.
Kovarik knows everything about everything.  Get him talking and he'll talk all class.  Really interesting stuff.
I wanna clear the air real quick - YES Kovarik is a talker, but he is also a listener - which is what you need in a major like media studies. Still cool wit me, BIll - even thought I still haven't gotten that reccomendation letter back from you!
Kovarik is a cool teacher I was able to get good web skills and I was also able to build my portfolio
Pleasant and usually professional. Likes students but rambles a lot.  Easy to follow, everything is on the web.
Dr. Kovarik is a nice guy.  If you don't need information spoonfed to you, take a class with Kovarik.  If you need alot of hand-holding, skip it.  Better in higher level classes/small classes than large ones - less effective in 101 or history than something like 226.  Appreciates hard work, or things that ""look"" like hard work.
Most of his stuff is online, and he doesn't really teach anything in class. The only time I've learned anything is from the multitude of videos he shows. However, if you watch them and read all the stuff online, you will do well. The projects are in groups & not too hard. He doesn't teach anything specific, though, just talks about random stuff.
Straight joke.  Sleep in class everyday because he just rambles on and on about nothing.  I honestly think I learned like...3 random facts all semiseter.  I dont really know what I am going to get in the class because all his**** is just wack.  But if you want to be bored and prolly get a decent grade, i guess go ahead and take him.
I'm fighting to stay in my major becuase of him.  He's horrible.  He drones on about nothing, then forgets to tell us quizzes are due on WebCT, he shows up late, and expects us to stay late because of it.  He bought 2 books on accident, and made us use both.  He's the worse teacher I have ever had in the entirety of my college & high school career.","This class is very boring. I sleep in class everyday.

541,"Prof. Skopik is a great guy who really cares about his students. Lecture is mandatory to do well. He also gives practice test which gives you a sense for his testing style. If you study hard AND understand his question style you'll do well in this class.
so nice and he was hilarious for an old dude.
Very easy going man, God bless his heart. Textbook is definitely a must to read to prepare for exams. Lectures are a guideline. The teacher is great! Take him! Compared to other bio teachers he is definitely the most understanding and treats students with respect. You're more than just a number in his class. He wants you to do well.
This class isn't a cakewalk but definitely passable if you put in a little effort. Curves every exam, tells goofy eccentric stories, and really keeps your attention for the whole class period. Take him!!
Very helpful and clear! Tests are not too difficult, and there is usually a nice curve. Skopik is very easygoing.
Skopik is a great guy. Really laid back and really interesting to listen to for lecture. However, his test making style is extremely vague and questions are often unclear. The lab final and lecture final for this class are IMPOSSIBLE. There simply isn't enough time to learn everything you need to know over winter session. Good luck, you'll need it.
Prof. Skopik is the best guy you could hope to have over Winter session. Really nice old man, but this class is unforgiving in the short few weeks you have in Winter session. Lecture is interesting and review games are played. Tests are unforgiving and sometimes unclear questions. Pray you have a good TA for Lab, its a huge part of the grade.
Professor Skopik's lectures are interesting but the exams are tough and lab final is even worse. Exam questions are hardly ever stated clearly.
Prof. Skopik covers fairly basic material in Honors BISC 207, but his tests are unforgiving. Lots of material is covered for each one, and his questions are phrased in such a way as to leave you unsure of your answer. He absolutely favors kids based on what high school they attend, and he treats this 200 level class as a 400 level class. DO NOT TAK
Skopik is my favorite professor. He makes class entertaining and very understandable. He gives tests that are partially open book but you still need to read and take notes. He loves telling hilarious stories which make everyone laugh, even at 8am. I recommend you take him if you get the chance. He is the epitome of what every teacher should be.
After the first few minutes of class you will realize that Professor Skopik is da man...His lectures are easy to follow, and he does tend to tell some funny stories to lighten the mood. Tests are a bit hard (the 15min open book portion is kinda useless).The lab final is nearly impossible. YOU WILL NEED THE TEXT BOOK!!Curvs Tests slightly.
Professor Skopik is a great professor. He is a master of keeping biology fun and changes up the monotony by telling stories. I took his course during summer sesh and the 2 hour lectures came a lot easier than it should have. Plays games that help you study! Tests are challenging but if you read and attend lecture(a must!) you'll get that A
Skopik is great. Took over winter sesh and surprisingly wasn't bad at all. Explains material and tells little old man stories during class that are funny and cute. Tests are hard, it is bio but overall a great prof and class. Read the book and listen in class. Def take him if you have the opportunity!
He is an amazing teacher. He is such a sweetheart and really loves what he does. His tests are a bit challenging but do the practice exams that he gives you to get a gist of it. Once you get used to the exam style you should be set! Very helpful and nice guy.
The funniest and most interesting man on campus hands down. Kept your attention in an early morning class. Entertained while he was teaching. Just wish his lab TAs were of higher quality.
Professor Skopik is such a funny and cute old man, one of my favorite professors at UD. I have a problem with falling asleep in early morning classes, but I actually looked forward to (and stayed awake in!) 8am lectures with Skopik. You have to read the book to do well, but definitely take him if you get the chance.
makes it easy to do well with ridiculous curves put on every test and then one at the end To do well read the book and attend lecture because he will throw random questions about examples given in class. Great teacher recommend
he is the cutest old man ever. he is an interesting professor. he notes can be all over the place but if you read the text book and then read the notes again they will make sense actually. naik was much less interesting and hard to understand. pay attention to skopiks funny examples he may ask about them on the test
Skopik's funny and is a good teacher. Though he doesn't use the text at all in class, you should read it before tests to do well. If you sign up for his class, be aware that Nauen may be the assistant professor and she is extremely boring. Skopik makes Bio interesting and is always in a good mood. One of the best professors, would recommend to all.
DO NOT take professor skopik. I mean he is a great guy and tries to make the material interesting. But if the tests covered material about what movie he had to watch and talk about to his grandson Johnny (Hannah Montana 3D concert) I would have easily gotten an A. His notes are very unclear and when studying I often read them over and didnt have an","He is the cutest old man ever. he is an interesting professor. If you sign up for his class, be aware that Nauen may be the assistant professor and she is extremely boring. "
542,"The year was tough she was in the hospital for almost all of it but that being said I really did like her as a professor. She really cares about the material and wants you to do well. Her quizzes are actually impossible tho matching but such small differences in the answers. 
This year was complicated because she was absent for most of the semester because of sickness. That said, she's super sweet and cares about what she's doing, and she deeply cares about all of her students. If you care, she'll care and try to help you out to the best of her ability.
However, her tests are pretty complicated and confusing so beware.
not the most interesting class but I do have to say Jill is a very easy grader as long as you write all your discussions as a raging liberal. The quizzes are brutal but barely dropped my grade. You also have to take them at a testing center which is dumb but overall I would say this is a simple breath to take. 
The class was asynchronous so I never met her. Lectures were extremely long twice a week with a lot of readings on top of it. Tests were extremely difficult and different from what is included in the slides. Makes you go to the testing center to take 3 tests. No textbooks but 3 chapter books are needed. Was supposed to be an easy A class.  
It's an asynchronous class that is a free elective and is expected to be an easy class, however, it is ridiculously difficult for absolutely no reason.
I took this class asynchronously and there were so many lectures, readings and discussions each week. I had some questions a few times so I emailed her and she was not helpful at all and quite frankly seemed pretty rude and annoyed by my questions every time. do not recommend everything will irritate you, terrible class, terrible professor.
Horrible. Tests make 0 sense and the definitions she gives have nothing to do with answers on the test. Our class average on quizzes is a literal 5 out of 25. She wont curve it, and its a waste of a class and will lower your GPA. Take a different class or get a different professor. 
Graded classwork is easy, but the lectures are awful. The topics are boring and she constantly stutters. Exams are extremely difficult and you have to apply the definition to the readings and lectures from class. Lots of readings too. I would not recommend for an ""easy A""
This class has so so much reading. There are 3 quizzes with 24 terms that you pull from the huge amount of reading. Although that sounds easy the definitions are very vague and it is hard to match. It will also take about 2 hours everyday to keep up with the work. I wish I knew this before I signed up for this class. Lectures are also very boring.
The workload is ridiculous and the assignments are not only confusing but have nothing to do with the quizzes. I didnt learn anything from this class even though I spent so much time completing her assignments. Would not recommend.
If you want an A in this class there is a lot of reading like 3 hours or more a week, but what you read and the documentaries you watch are so rewarding its worth it. Her essay grading is fair and relatively easy as long as you put some work in but the quizzes are tricky, you have to know minute details for it so they're tough
Idk where this lady gets off with all the time consuming assignments. Would never take again, ridiculous workload and unfair quizzes
ANTH101 is not for you if you don't like reading and learning about culture. It is a challenging course, but extremely engaging and you will get out of it exactly what you put in (do not expect grade inflation or an ""easy A""). The quizzes are not impossible if you do the (many) readings - in fact, they are quite clear and easy if you prepare well.
The class itself is fine and the quizzes are not difficult if you study the material beyond just definitions.
Professor Neitzel gives good feedback and replies quick, but don't take this class if you're looking for something that's going to be easy. I took this class asynchronously online and it was heavy on extra readings. Her quizzes are also matching based but are extremely difficult due to the unclear question wording. Very few relate back to lecture.
The professor is nice, response to emails fast, and the essays and discussion posts aren't too bad. What is worst is the exams in this class. The formatting is horrific with answer choices being extremely unclear. At the moment about 3/4 of the class has not gotten higher than 30% on the exams, and the only thing she said was to ""Study more"".
She is super nice and quick to answer emails. However, her quizzes have nothing to do with the lecture material, the modules have so much in them, and the discussions are loosely based off of the content. If you take this class the readings and reading study guides will be your best friend.
Her tests are more than confusing. I spent hours studying for them and felt like I knew the material yet failed every single exam due to her confusing formatting and unclear question responses. She threatened to give me a 0 on the final for one mistake. I thought this would be an easy A and interesting class but it turned out to be a pain.
Took ANTH101 online, absolutely terrible, would NOT recommend. All discussion posts are pointless, quizzes don't make any sense/have much relevance to what was actually discussed in lectures. I didn't learn much of anything about anthropology, yet spent way too much time doing work for this class.
Three quizzes during a semester and a take-home essay as a final. The quizzes are just about the definitions and maps and they're absurd, they have nothing to do with the definitions she gives during the lectures. Don't waste your time doing the readings, there are quizlets done just google them, listen to lectures do extra cr it should be easy A.","The professor is nice, response to emails fast, and the essays and discussion posts aren't too bad. However, her quizzes have nothing to do with the lecture material, the modules have so much in them, and the discussions are loosely based off of the content."
543,"Her lectures move along, and it is easy to get lost if you don't keep up. But if you make an effort to listen and contribute, you will learn a ton! Make the effort to talk to her, both in and outside of class; you will be amazed at her ability to open your eyes to socioeconomic issues you'd never considered before.
Most ridiculous class I've ever taken. TA was way too hard on grading. Exams/ Essays were entirely on the books-- you need to know every single detail if you want to do well in this class. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this class.
READ THE BOOKS.  midterm is based solely on questions relevant to the book, she's somewhat of a tough grader.  final is take home essay her 2nd book.  group projects were very easy, not a bad class at all if you're interested in the topic.  i barely went to classes when she lectured and will end up with a B+.  not as bad as everyone makes is sound
I went abroad with Yda. She definitely knows what she talks about, and we learned a lot on the excursions. She isn't the easiest grader, but I learned a lot. Highly recommend taking her, especially abroad!
The professor is easy to understand! She assigns very interesting and up to date books as the course material. She is more appropriate to teach at the graduate level because she gives minimum guidance, not everyone gets her - yet she smart, not boring.
TAs start teaching class 1/2 way thru semester, she is an ok lecturer. Class is based on 2 books= 2 exams, and 1 group final project= no final exam. I never went to class just read the books and showed up last 3 weeks for project and got a B+. Class is easy and somewhat interesting, you watch a few movies along the way too.
Absolutely horrible in terms of her teaching. BORING and redundant. The material isnt hard but its EXTREMELY HARD to stay awake. She talks really quiet and kind of rambles on. Use a computer for this class cause she has a lot of notes. The midterm was easy but the final was hard. If you're not an IR major, AVOID THIS CLASS!
horrible teacher. can't understand a word she says in class but she put a huge curve on our midterm and probably final as well because i ended up with a B+ when i legit thought i failed. i would definitely recommend someone else
Avoid. Incredibly boring lecturer, hard to stay interested unless you legitimately enjoy geography. The textbook is useful, but do not buy the atlas. Didn't even open it once.
Very easy class, great MC requirement. Lectures are interesting and tests are mostly based on lectures. Very easy mapquizzes worth 30% of the grade and final is not cumulative. Professor is very knowledgeable and answers questions well. Overall, I had a great experience in this class and would recommend it. Very easy midterm.
Could fall asleep easier in this class than my dorm.  Dull, but not too hard a class.
Yda is a really interesting lady if you get to talk to her. She has an agenda, especially with her new book, and she slants that way a lot. Her voice can put you to sleep, but if you read the books you'll do fine on the exams. She grades writing easily.
Pretty interesting and relevant material but presented in the worst way.  Boring, unclear, unstructured lectures.  2 tests, midterm and final are multiple choice.  Some questions are very easy and some come out of nowhere.  Small curves on tests.  Her review guides are vague but tell you what NOT to read in the textbook.
Read this if your going to take Geog 120 : This is a challenging intro course, you do not need to attend class but you MUST read everything to do OK on the 3 exams. You do learn valuable information. The professor is useless, she is hard to understand and you do not benefit that much from going to class...Just read everything.
Very hard to understand! I learned nothing and actually put a lot of effort into trying to learn something! Course def. was not structured to be an introductory course. SUPER HARD! WARNING:  DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR if you want to get a good grade!
She is the worst professor of my life. It was impossible to stay awake in her lectures, and I still ask myself why I even bothered everyday. She was very unclear with what was going to be on the test. You should definitely not take her, but if you do, just know that she's real big on the economic aspects of her class.
Horrible. Dont bother with the class.
She is economically biased in her lectures and is not clear at all especially with the exam questions she uses.  This makes the class too hard for an introductory level class.  She'll also skip over major topics that are ""not important"".  Her lectures are boring and she has trouble making her major point clear.  I would not recommend her.
Not an especially hard class if you can read and comprehend the material and notes handed out. It's just that I think few, if anyone really understood what it was that Yda 'Goldmember' Schreuder was talking about with that accent and boring tone. Just read the book and the notes, try to catch what countries she's discussing and read up on them.","She is economically biased in her lectures and is not clear at all especially with the exam questions she uses. This makes the class too hard for an introductory level class.  She'll also skip over major topics that are ""not important""."
544,"Professor May is clearly a very smart man and a more than passable teacher, but he can isn't easy to communicate with and can be quite short in emails. At times he is flat out rude. I didn't feel comfortable sharing in his course or asking for help. 
Great teacher
This is my 2nd class with Dr. May and, again, I loved it. He's a very good lecturer-very easy to follow. Uses a lot of interesting documentaries (sometimes too many though). Try to stay on top of the class readings-he looks for that in the exams. Sweet man and really wants the students to get something out of the class.
Great class for breadth. Lectures were very interesting and humorous, interspersed with movie clips and fun trivia. Wished the tests weren't essays, as I couldn't seem to make the exact connections he wanted. A 3 hour movie can really fill up your night activities, but attendance wasn't mandatory and he played key clips in lecture next class.
If you are looking for an easy breadth requirement, take this class. You didn't really have to go to any lectures to do well. The tests were in the form of essays this year, and if you incorporated everything he asked you (readings, movie clips, and lectures) and put in a little effort, you can't do poorly. Easy A/B.
Absolutely loved May! HIST221 is my favorite class I've had in college yet. I enjoyed all of the movies he picked and the lectures were interesting as well. May's a sweet man and I felt bad when people weren't paying attention. 2 midterm papers & a final-not bad at all. Take this class!
Very opinionated and could be perceived as pompous. If you don't say what he wants you to in his essay, it is automatically wrong. Must use class readings, decent lectures.
AWESOME class.. Professor May is very passionate about both history and movies. He's a great  teacher and makes you really think when having to write the 3 papers the class consists of. I look forward to taking future history classes with him! Highly recommend both the class and him as a professor!
If you like movies, this is the group B for u. His lectures r very interesting.  3 papers r required (7-10 pages long). Not very clear on what an A paper should include, so ask & the Prof & TAs are very helpful. there r a lot of readings but that may be standard for a group B. Not a difficult class but certainly time consuming. still I recommend it
Professor May is great for American History! His lectures usually consist of at least 2 movie clips/day which makes class more enjoyable. Definitely go to his office hours to get pointers for the midterm/final and you'll do great! All around great teacher!
Great lectures, movies varied in quality if you ask me. Paper grading was a bit tough, but the lectures were really fun to attend. You need to write 3 papers, beware!
I loved this class! The lectures were so interesting and fun! Essays were graded a bit tough but definitely a class worth taking.  Movies were a ton of fun and surprisingly useful in remembering and analyzing historic events.
I absolutely LOVE this man. He's such a great professor. His lectures are so interesting, he analyzes awesome films and relates them to their time period which gave some of them a whole new meaning to me. His assignments are all take home, which means exams, and they're ridiculously easy. Honestly,  Easy A and worth taking!
This guy is a great professor to have for a film class because he is just in love with the movies. And since he loves the subject matter so much, he really engages you and gets you interested in the class. Awesome guy.
Although you get to watch movies every week, this isn't an easy class. There are 3 papers that make up your entire grade, and he grades the papers extremely hard. A traditional history class is much fairer in grading. He is so subjective that it?s ridiculous.  You can't win in this class. I would not recommend it at all.
I think this man is very opinionated and unhelpful. If you don't agree with his perspective 100%, then he talks down on you. He's knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter, but that doesn't make him a good professor. I also thought that most of the films were extremely boring, as well as the lectures. I wouldn't recommend him.
Gary was very knowledgable about his subject matter. Every movie we watched was interesting. The papers were not difficult, and the TA's were fairly easy graders. However, he definitely had strong historical opinions and liked you to agree with them. Overall the once a week class was fun and a nice break.
Gary May is one of the best professors I have had at UD. Extremely knowledgable about his subject, very clear, genuinely wants his students to do well. I look forward to going to class each week, it was so interesting.
Would never take him again. He's very blah. This was a seminar, so he expected a lot of student participation, but he didn't seem to want to guide discussions AT ALL, which meant the class ultimately failed. I was bored every single day I had to go. He's not a bad guy but he's not a good prof either.
One of my favorite professors at the university. I enjoygoing to class everyday. I like history, but he makes it very interesting with the different media he uses. Fair grader...midterm, final which consist of a long essay to answer. I definitely recommend him.","This guy is a great professor to have for a film class because he is just in love with the movies.

549,"Ha - maybe 105 wa an easy A, but if you were taking classes for a major, that was NOT the case. Dr. Thompson was THE best teacher I ever had. He won teacher of the year while I was there and deserved it. Very passionate about the subject, and an all-around good person. It's been thirty years, and I still remember him fondly enough to come rate him.
Utter cake class. Take it with the lab for your Group D requirements. ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES. The distance learning section is a bit scattered, but probably even easier than the class version. And the material is actually quite interesting.
Class was a joke..never went to class, never even read. The study guide he gives out is better than the notes he gives during lecture and the test is based totally from it. Got an A. If u want a free GPA boost with the least amount of seriousness and effort required, take this class!
Easy class, skipped a lot, didn't read the book. Gives a study guide before each exam, if you know them you'll know what to do. Four multiple choice quizes make up 65% of your grade, you drop the lowest one. The final is 25% and is somewhat tricky, old exams will help also if you can get them.
Doc is the best. Easy exams, easy class.
Class is easy- tests are straight from studyguide.  Don't bother reading- just look at diagrams in book.
(Wilmington campus) Passionate, but scatterbrained (""I forgot to grade your exams...""). Material is boring, but that's not his fault. Lectures a bit hard to follow. Somewhat unclear on how to prepare projects and what will be on exams. Good guy, loves to talk geography! Group project and 3 exams.
Not a hard class at all. The best thing to do is to go over the study guide and go to class at least once a week and you'll do fine. Don't bother reading, everything on the tests is from the lecture.
He's really boring, but he loves his class. I have fallen asleep because he is such a bad lecturer though. I know he can't help it, but the stuttering drives me crazy. He seems like a nice guy, but he isn't the best prof.
he's so awesome and helpful and tries so hard...def need to study to do well (B or higher)
Awesome guy, very personable. The class is easy, however, you do have to look over the study guide the night before the exam in order to pull off a B. Some advice: search UD's site for older versions of his exams, they have similar questions.
This is in no way an easy A...I fell into that trap. You will have to study. Lectures painful but he's a good guy.
Nice guy.  Go into his office sometime and talk to him.  If you read the study guides--and nothing else--you are guaranteed a B in the class.  Interesting material.
Doc is so cute and passionate about hazards.  Class isnt as easy as everyone says, you do have to study to get a B
Easy class, best teacher! he's the cutest little guy and he makes science funny. just read the study guide and you'll do fine. definitely take this class for a group D
The lectures were pretty boring, but he is the nicest man ever. He will do anything to help you do well, and is really understanding
This is the easiest class ever.  If you cannot pull off an A, I dont know how you got into this University.  Honestly now, take this class, get an A.
Definitely not an easy A--I don't know if you can even get one if you work your but off, but even if you don't do any work you'll get a B if you just read the study guide prior to the test.  He comes out with some pretty funny quotes
DOC ROCKS!!!!
the class is deffinately not as easy as everyone says...quiz questions don't all come from the study guide and the final is cumalative...take a different science if you can!","Teachers were praised for being passionate about the subject and caring for their students, but their lecturing style was sometimes criticized. Some students recommend taking the class for a group requirement, while others suggest looking for older versions of exams to help with studying. Overall, the reviews offer a diverse range of experiences and opinions on the classes and teachers."
560,"John Jebb is a good guy, but he is very old school and barely knows how to use a computer. He doesn't use canvas, only email. Don't take his class unless you want to write about 13 essays in the semester. There is an essay due almost every Sunday. No rubrics for the essays/very vague prompts. Grades so harshly with little comments for correction.
He was a very tough grader, likes student papers to be his way (not going too much detail and not straying from the topic of the paper). I put a lot of effort into my papers and would still get low grades, however, if you met with him during office hours and re-did the paper after hearing what needs to be fixed then he fixes your grade. 
The only class I have taken at the University where hard work and effort don't pay off. The stress this class put on me was unnecessary - take with another prof. I have never gotten a grade above a C and never have I had issues with my writing in the past. Prepare for ambiguous prompts and no rubrics - ruined my senior year. 
Ancient.
DO NOT take a class with this man. I've never had an issue with my writing but I consistently was getting C's on my papers. I met up with him before class where he did not give good feedback and still have never received higher than a B+ on any of my papers. He gives too much work with too little feedback and grades super harshly. He must retire.
John Jebb is kinda weird. He keeps an engaging energy throughout the semester which is pretty refreshing to see. His grading criteria and document sharing/submission methods makes me believe that he hasn't adapted much from his teaching ways since the early 90s. Everything is over email, canvas is not used ever, and his grading is wacky.
This class is hard. If you aren't an english major take someone else. Essays almost every weekend which are impossible to get an A on. If this is the only section left just take this class in a later semester with a different prof. I show up and participate every day and I think I'm gonna get a C maybe a B- if im lucky
This guy seems so nice in person, but grades so hard on papers for absolutely no reason and gives vague feedback. I got a C on a paper and the feedback was literally ""contained a lot of good content. Needed to focus more on content"". If you want to go to office hours all the time take him, but I wouldn't recommend.
This man is the worst, most annoying, and unclear professor I have ever had. Every sunday is a paper that he will fail you for. He does not use canvas and is unclear about the exact things he is looking for in his assignments. The class is nothing but him blabbering weird remarks. When I say do not take this man. DO NOT.
Nice professor, a bit eccentric. Doesn't use canvas which is very annoying. You absolutely need to take go to class and take notes to know what to do on assignments. Lots of assignments. Don't read the book unless he directly tells you to read a portion. Make sure that you participate in class. I got an A and I don't consider myself a good writer.
Jebb is a good guy who is super passionate about his subject, but he is extremely outdated. He doesn't use a canvas page and you have to go to class to have any idea how to do the assignments. He literally takes role every class for a participation grade so you have to go. Assignments are generic but you really have to work to for a good grade
Very great and passionate guy. Classes were usually pretty interesting. Can be a pretty tough grader but it's evident he cares and wants you to succeed.
I have no doubt John Jebb is a good man, but that in no way means he is good at his job. This is the most useless class I have ever taken and he is impossible. Ancient, no canvas, constant one page papers where you have to use 6 sources. Tells you ""not enough substance"". How could there be its one page. Please listen to me. SAVE YOURSELF DONT TAKE
Terrible class. Don't listen to the bootlickers here who give him good reviews. They would give him good reviews irregardless of class quality. Such a boring man. Doesn't use canvas. Ancient. Requires attendance. You'll never understand the dichotomy of being assigned one page papers but getting comments like ""insufficient content"". Save yourself.
His class has more work than most other ENG110 classes. But he is a great man who is very passionate about what he teaches. He comes to class everyday excited to teach.
Not a difficult class at all, but it's a lot of busy-work. For an ENGL110 class I received so much more work than my friends who were in other sections. Again, none of it was too difficult but be prepared to read each and every week. Those 1 page summaries due at the end of each week were the worst.
Get ready to read 100-300 pages a week depending on the books he chooses to assign. After reading you have to write a one page paper on a topic he chooses. Might be the worst class I have taken at UD,If you are a full time student and don't have/want to dedicate the time to read an entire book every week, don't take this class Also not 2nd writing
Dr. Jebb is kind and caring if not boisterous and a *bit* eccentric. Participate often in class and you'll get better grades on your essays. He has frequent office hours which are quite helpful for boosting your essay grades. Be prepared for a lot of reading and a large number of essays.
Actually a really nice man. But: no rubrics, ambiguous essay prompts and syllabus, tough grader, didnt learn much. Lecture is useless - just talking about the plot details of the books we read. GO TO OFFICE HOURS with a rough draft and do what he says. I started getting As the moment I went to office hours. Thankful I was a good writer going in.
Jebb is passionate & is a great teacher. There is a decent amount of work: he alternates short stories, novels, & movies with a 1 page paper due every Mon based on what you read/ watched. Confusing at first but you will quickly get the hang of it and will probably end up loving it even if you think you're going to hate it. PARTICIPATE AT ALL COST","He requires attendance, doesn't use Canvas, and provides little feedback on papers. Overall, some found the class to be manageable with effort, but others advise taking a different professor or avoiding the class altogether."
562,"This class has a lot of daily reading that you're quizzed on each class, but as long as you actually read, the quizzes are really basic. The texts are short and easy, the papers are a breeze, and Bruckner is very nice, funny, and will love you if you participate.
He's so good. I love this Swedish man. HIs handwriting is incomprehensible but it's fine because of how great he is at leading discussions and giving feedback (if you ask for it). Absolutely the best option for American Lit. Take him!
It was really difficult to take this  class because I care about 0% about American literature and of course the English major I was stuck with as a senior required me to take it. He was at least engaging and I still managed a good grade even though I barely read the book (I don't recommend that though) and he's very understanding if you need help.
Brueckner is the man. The dude is pretty clever, is really good and loves what he does in the english department. The books you read in this class are usually pretty goodpretty famous. Not to mention, awesome German accent. Would take this class again with him, had a quality time. However, he takes attendance, which cost me an A. haha
He was really helpful the class is a lot of reading but its interesting and he is always willing to help you on anything for the class. He genuinely cares about his students.
He is a really nice guy and wants his students to do well. This class has A LOT of reading involved but other than that not too much writing involved as long as you read and pay attentionparticipate its not too bad. 
I would take anything taught by this guy. He's one of those professors who gets you interested in whatever you're reading, and somehow is able to keep class from ever getting boring. It's a lot of reading, but it's manageable, and he really wants you to do well. If you read and go to class you'll pass the exams. 
Great professor! Take!
Professor Bruekner is one of the best professors I've met. He really makes the subject interesting, and he makes coming to class quite worth it. He's also very understanding and accomodating, but this should not be exploited or taken advantage of. you still need to make an effort!
Awesome professor-makes seemingly boring texts interesting, and he definitely promotes thought more than writing. You choose the grade you want, and then just meet the requirements for it (an A, for example, might entail 8 two-page think pieces, 2 revisions, and a two page option paper), and he's really flexible and helpful. Nice guy, fun class.
This was the most thought provoking class I have ever taken. He did a really good job expanding my thinking. He made some pretty dense reading really interesting. I was never one to read for my classes, but I always read for this class. I participated in the discussions, which I rarely did in my other classes. I don't know what it was about him!
Course ended up being pretty dull. He forgets that his students are taking other classes and loads on a lot of reading. He also ordered too many books and the class ended up costing me more money than I have ever spent on an English class. I would not take him again.
Don't take him if you are a dude.
This may have been the best class I took at UD.  Martin is brilliant, but he leads discussions in such a way that you understand how he thinks and can then do it on your own.  Where other profs focus on writing, he emphasizes thought.  Taking a class with him will change the way you think about life.
This class OWNED my life for a whole semester- the reading was dense and he really throws you into it. At first I HATED this class but I ended up loving it. He's a genius but really interested in what you have to say about the text. TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM, I felt 10x's smarter afterwards. Exams are spit back from the lecture- just DON'T skip class!
Brueckner is a great teacher! His lectures are very interesting and assignments aren't hard. Only gives 9 short papers, or 6 short and 1 long. Pretty easy grader, gives extra credit and can rewrite one paper. Take a class with Brueckner if you're an English major..must take!
Bruekner is an excellent professor. I would highly recommend his American Lit I course.  His lectures are very enjoyable. I only wish that the class was longer, so that I could learn more from him.
One of the top two professors I've had at UD.  He is helpful, flexible, clear, brilliant, insightful, and wants you to succeed.  Class is interesting and makes you want to attend.  Assignments are frequent, but short and managable.  If you have to take an English class, take Brueckner.
The best teacher that I have had in my three and a half years at this school. Take whatever course he offers, unless you don't like to write. His grading policy does rely predominantly on weekly three paragraph essays.","Brueckner is described as a nice, funny, and accommodating professor who genuinely cares about his students. However, some students mention that the class can be difficult and require a lot of time and effort, and one student advises against taking Brueckner if you are a male."
564,"The class is doable. Prepare to devote roughly 5 hours to each homework. Interesting subject matter. However Case's brain functions at such a high level it seems as though you are listening to a humorous Microsoft Sam dictate the text book to you. You should have gotten at least a B in discrete to be able to handle this.
Extremely entertaining, but also thorough and meticulous in his teaching. He knows his stuff and makes sure you know it too. Not a class you'll breeze through, but it's not impossible if you're willing to put forth a little effort.
Amazing guy, funny little man.  Hilarious to listen to at times, but make sure to focus on what he says.  It helps to listen carefully and parse what you're hearing as he says it, but he and his TA are always available for office hours.  Also, make sure you know what happened last class when you come back.  Quite professional as well.
The man is a genius... he knows more about these subjects than probably anyone else at the University.  His zeal and enthusiasm for teaching are also unmatched.  That being said, he simply is on another plane of existence.  He speeds through the material at a breakneck pace and just assumes that people will understand it.  Tough, but good curve.
He's a really nice guy, doesn't realize that he kind of insults your intelligence at times.  ""It's just a simple grade school algebra trick"" doesn't help my confidence.  All in a a fascinating course, but don't take it if you're not going to be interested in the theory, because its most likely not going to be a GPA booster.
ummm, let's see... final was worth 50% of the grade, curve is ok at the end, but plainly put, John Case does not speak human.  If you can't understand logic at the beginning of the class, your only hope is to devoutly read both of the books or talk to your TA a lot.  He is a funny guy in a geeky way, but if you can manage it try to take anyone else
very hard class, alot of work (expect to do 3-5 hours per homework).  Has absolutely the worst handwriting.  But just ask alot of questions and goto his or the TAs office hours often and you should be fine.  ALSO note for future students theres talk of splitting this class into 2 seperate classes so take now while you still can!
I adore Dr. Case, but this class is ridiculously difficult for most people.  I'm doing better than expected, since I already have a very strong base in formal logic, but ask for help, and you will be fine.  Don't take if you won't bother to do the work, and there's a lot of it.
Fascinating class.  Excellent person.  Class is ridiculously hard.  Don't take with more than one other class, ideally. Case is very nice but it's hard for him to communicate at time.  He does try though.  Expect at least 3-4 hours of studying per night for this class (all 7 days of the week).
These classes have very hard material, and Professor Case doesn't always have the best time explaining concepts, but he definitely cares about his students, and is always willing to help.  (Plus he has a great geeky sense of humor!)
If you don't want to be a theoretician don't take this class. Ignore your advisor. Case, for whatever reason, lacks the ability to teach humans. So, instead, each class Case strives to break his personal records for the number of Greek characters written on a blackboard in 75 min.
John Case is an Ardvark, I have the proof in a handout that he provided.
Can you handle it?
Do NOT take this class if you learn like normal people do.  He'll just go up there and write stuff for hours before you learn what it's used for.  Even then it's iffy.  He'll explain things by writing algorithms, not by telling you what they do.  Not enough helpful (easy) examples.
Very nice guy, ridiculously hard class. Go to his office hours for help with homework, you'll need it. However, with the huge CPEG-ish curve (20% is a D-), as long as you make some effort, you should be all right.
Avoid!  Garbage class, teacher not any better.  Any class where you can have a 20% average and still pass (yes, the curve is that large) is fundamentally flawed.  Boring and out of touch, book is from the 1970's.","Many students emphasize the importance of devoting a significant amount of time to homework and seeking help from the TA and professor during office hours. Some students mention the class being curved, which may be a factor to consider. Based on the reviews, it seems that the class is doable for students who have a strong foundation in discrete mathematics and are interested in the theory, but it may not be a good fit for those who prefer a more traditional teaching style or are looking for an easy GPA booster."
567,"TAs do a lot of the work. But he does a good job teaching during lectures. Take notes and definitely go to the discussion section. Ling is a hard subject and he wants his students to do well.
He is a very nice guy. He wants his students to pass, and he makes it known. He's also forgiving when it comes to any mishaps with grades since language is so pliable. Unfortunately, he does not teach the class at all really. The TAs do everything, and I don't even know what mine is talking about half of the time. The quizzes and tests are hard.
Go to class-but the slides go to fast and he skips over slides. also, there are only 3 exams-that are about 30-40 questions each. and 5 homeworks that you need to do well. if you make an attempt-he wont really care either. he doesnt have office hours & puts everything off on his ta's.
He makes everything seem so much harder then it is. My TA's are foreign and its hard to understand them which doesn't help. Be prepared to teach the material to yourself, that's the only way I understood it. I had to put in a lot of work to get to that point too.
TA's should get his paycheck
Professor Cole was a terrible professor. He only taught one day a week, and barely taught. His ta's which were foreign, did all of the grading and did more than the actual professor did. Do not take his class. he makes everything seem much harder & the homework is difficult.
He is the best professor I've ever had.  Although he makes you work a lot, it's totally worth it.  YOU WILL BENEFIT A LOT IF YOU ACTUALLY DO THE READING.  Anyone who complains about his class just doesn't feel like actually working for a change.
He is very hard, but very fair.  Be prepared with your facts and he will expand your mind.  Really nice guy, and the smartest teacher I have ever had.
This is probably the best professor at UDEL.  We are lucky to have him.  Only people who were looking for an easy class are complaining.  Everything is well laid out & it is easy to get an A if you pay attention to the course materials.
He is the man and he is very clear and he is extremely funny.  Full of personality.  Class is easy.
Not a great class- content is boring and hard to understand for first half of semester- you really don't interact w/ Prof Cole at all- everything is done through your TA's - Curve and extra credit are very helpful- some TA's are foreign
Worst teacher ever! Stupid ideas, walks around with a microphone and his TA's barely speak English...meanwhile the class is linguistics...the study of language! Go figure...don't take him, stay away. HORRIBLE!
Do not take this class! Very difficult and boring. Only some of the TA's are good so get out while you can!
This is a warning: don't do this to yourself!
do urself a favor... do not take him...
Useless class...Hardcore curve...Boring lectures, but I went to laugh at Peter talk. Thank God for TA's...although its funny that they can barely speak english, yet are teaching you linguistics.","His teaching style and find the class challenging but worthwhile, while others feel that the class is difficult and boring, and that the TAs are doing most of the teaching. Some students also mention language barriers with the TAs, which can make it harder to understand the material. Overall, it seems that students should be prepared to put in a lot of work and possibly teach themselves some of the material, and that the quality of the class may depend on the TA they are assigned to."
568,"Giza's lectures are clear and informative. She tries her best to keep your attention by throwing out interactive examples through class. She tries to make it so that the class is easy to pass. Her test are not bad at all if you prepare for them. She allows flash cards and you get free skips. Help is there if you go to her office hours. 
Took her at WCU, absolutely loved her. She is very sweet, knows her stuff and tries to make her lectures engaging. Provides tons of extra credit opportunities. Some people have difficulty on her exams but she lets you use note cards during them so make them and study! Text book is mandatory to pass this class! Lots of homework but they're so easy!
You don't have to attend the class to get a mediocre grade if that's what you're striving for. The textbook is used, but she goes over a lot of the material on powerpoints (posted on d2l). Attendance counts, but you use clickers. If you don't show up, you'll be fine catching up, but your attendance will just go down.
This was a really fun lab. I loved her in the beginning; however, at the end when it came to writing our final paper and final getting graded on something she was so incredibly UNHELPFUL! She is the most unorganized person I have ever met and this class ended up being my most stressful one. I got an A,but I almost pulled my teeth out in the process
Dr. Giza was extremely disappointing for me. I enjoyed her class in the beginning, but once I had questions to ask her, she was very inconsiderate, unhelpful, and frankly confrontational. She says she'll do all that she can to help you, but that was not my experience at all.
I thought this class was hard to concentrate in.  She would go off on these tangents and after that I couldn't return to the text.
Very nice lady, interesting subject, very fair grader, just not as easy as I thought it would be!
I took this class in Summer College and I learned a lot.  Dr. Giza was really nice, despite the dancing and references to ""abracadabra."" Good class.
I had her for Summer College, she's a very dedicated professor, but always manages to get behind no matter what.  The only way she teaches is through powerpoint-which gets a bit boring after awhile.  But overall-she's one of the most fair profs ever.
her classes are so pointless except that she takes random attendance.  you dont ever need to take notes or pay attention. just read what she assigns, maybe take notes on that and the study guide book that is optional really helps.
Interesting subject (of course I love psychology). To me, not all that great of a teacher but nice and she loves the subject. Read the book to pass the tests. Lectures prove to be a breif review of what you read.
Had her in Psyc301 and she was great.  The tests were were challenging but fair. You can drop up to 10 questions.  But study lots and go to class
Such a sweetheart. Always available for class. Very interested in her students. Makes all information understandable by relating to things we understand
great prof, great stories, explains most everything really well, but read the book too, cuts you a ton of breaks
i LOVED her and feel honored to have had her-she's the reason I chose my major. very interesting material. go to class and use study guide for tests.  not an easy A, but well worth it--SO interesting
Had her for both 201 and 301.  The reason kids love her is because she says everything kids want to hear from a prof about grades and tests. material is common sense but notes arent so study HARD to get an A.
not that bad of a class, had her for both classes 301 is harder. if u have to take no big deal but not an easy a
Had her for both classes...And I love her.  Shes real easy and as long as you do the study guide (its kinda long though) you'll do fine on the tests.  Plus you get to pick 50/60 questions to awnser on the tests and the final is optional! Highly Recommende
very nice lady and very helpful if you ask, tests are hard if you don't prepare ahead of time, in class and take home sections, gives study guide and have to read, very flexible in scheduling, if you don't like psyc don't take it","Some students enjoyed her lectures and found her to be engaging and informative. Others found her to be disorganized and unhelpful, especially when it came to assignments and exams. The consensus seems to be that attendance is important, but note-taking and studying from the textbook are also essential for success in her classes. Some students found her exams to be challenging, but appreciated that she offered study guides and allowed note cards during tests. Additionally, some students felt that she was a fair grader and appreciated her flexibility in scheduling."
569,"Matsons' class involves her lecturing for the entire class while you take notes, write down the slides and what she says and you should do fine, do the study guide a few days before the exam and study, exams are 6 open ended questions out of 8 and I got an 85 on all 4 by just showing up to class, taking notes, and doing the study guide
The class is all lecture based, so if you go to class and take good notes you'll be fine, but its very boring. Very boring. I recommend doing the readings online and taking notes on them too. Her study guides are helpful for the exam and the exams are not hard at all.
She wrote the textbook so she posts it online for free. 4 tests with 6 short answer questions, you know exactly what to expect. Gives a study guide. You have to go to pass. You aren't allowed to take notes on a computer. The class overall was boring since she just lectures but the material was interesting.
4 tests with 6 short answer questions.  She assigns reading(gives you online textbk for free) dont need to do it but helps to skim to get random details to throw onto the test, which she likes.  She gives you a study guide which is very similar to the test. Need to go to class to get good notes so you have a bunch of info for the essays
Class is an Easy A. Record her lecture on your phone if you can and just listen to them 3 days before the Exam. 4 Exams no midterms or final.  Attendance isn't required but going to class is essential to even pass it. The book is a waste of time even though she will stress on reading it because she wrote it.
Don't take this class if you already know about America up to the Revolutionary war. The lectures are really long and don't go into depth very much. She only gives 4 exams all semester, and they're short answer pick six out of eight prompts. It isn't that hard but it isn't that interesting. 
If you have the patience to sit in silence for an hour and listen to her go on and on, this class is for you. I love the material, and the only work at all are to create diary entries. No exam. It is a super easy class, literally no work involved. However, her lectures are the most boring hour of my day. 
I don't know why people say Matson is difficult. First off grading is done by her TA's NOT her so you can't really say she's an arbitrary grader. Getting an A in the class is unbelievably easy if you follow this SIMPLE formula: go to class, take notes, and read the textbook starting a day or two days before the exam. Instant A.
Gives study guides for tests. as long as you know those you will be good for the test. lets you choose 6 of the 7 questions on the test. Lectures are boring, but important. Take notes because most of the test questions are in the lectures.
Does not grade fairly. Tests are essay based so she can always just take points off for missing one small detail or saying be more specific. boring class, no discussion, ruined my gpa
Professor Matson presents the material in an organized fashion. As long as you take notes, read occasionally and look at your notes before the class there's no reason why you shouldn't get an A in this class.
She never graded fair, not even when you completely understood the miserable material she preached. No discussion, 25 minutes per quiz for like 3-4 pages (SAT anyone?). Gives you a word and asks you to write and she can end up stating ""add more detail"" and giving u little credit for it. Wrote her textbook and shakes her jaw in disbelief whenspoken
If you go to class, take good notes, and put some effort in to study, this class is an easy B. She's a great teacher who clearly knows her stuff (she wrote the online textbook you'll use, which you don't really need to read even though she says too.). The class can get a bit boring, but it could be worse. Overall, I recommend this class!
She knows her stuff and can be nice most of the time. She gets visibly aggravated when she THINKS no one's done the reading regardless of whether they've done it or not. She ruined my 4.0 GPA in History courses. Grading was mostly arbitrary. The main assignments were diary entries and it seemed she wanted everything she said rewritten in two pages.
take her! she is really nice and wants everyone to do well! show her you care about her class and what she is talking about and you'll get a good grade
nice lady, will help you out in any way.  really cares about her students. Very smart and hot too. Great prof, knows her material and engages her students.
Classes are relatively boring. She mostly reads from her powerpoint slides. She loves showing pictures. If you show up to class, take notes, and read from the book its definitely an easy A. Her tests are fair and you can do well as long as you study. Overall it's not a bad class and Dr. Matson is very nice and helpful.
Extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and approachable.  Good overheads and review sessions too
In discusion class, she does most of the work for you. You have write some papers but she is an easy grader. I am curious to see her in a lecture. I recommend her.
One of the most boring history classes I have ever taken. Total lecture, but Matson is not clear about her assigments! No directions whatsoever, and gets angry when students ask her to clarify...avoid if possible!","Professor Matson's exams consist of short answer questions, and some of the questions can be answered by material from lectures. The readings from her online textbook may be helpful but not necessary. Overall, it seems that students who put in effort and attend lectures may be able to do well in the class. However, those who are looking for a more engaging history class may not find this course to their liking."
570,"If you think and writewhat she want which is pretty ridiculous to me you can get good grades easily. If you are creative, find another teacher!!!
Very bad professor. Always late, always disorganized, loses your papers, keeps you late after class, handwriting is illegible, incompetent. Takes attendance. Not an easy A. Not recommended at all.
This class was the easiest class in the world, but her disorganization made it impossible! always came to class late, didnt follow syllabus. She is a good person and a horrible teacher
She's very sweet and understanding. A tad disorganized, but only in an amusing way- it doesn't hinder her teachign ability. It's true, we don't do a lot in class, but you SHOULD get the book because it's interesting. I was sokced that anyone didn't like her- she is a very good teacher for a freshman english course.
Too Easy!! 3 Papers, and all discusion....Easy A!!  She's late everyday, and is very disorganized, however, she is soooo nice!! Easy Grade!!
Very easy class. Easy A.
Ridiculously easy, shes so disorganized you wonder how she makes it through every day.  Disappears in the middle of class every day, don't bother buying the books.
She gave us a handout saying attendence was required---but it really didn't matter. I was too lazy to do any revision or put in more than 20 minutes on any given assignment.  Still got a B+.
Easy Class, shes very disorganized, but just turn in assignments and revise- Dont buy the book
Easy class, but she doesn't know anything.  Don't go to class and don't buy any books. Just turn in your assignments and revise them and you'll be fine.
Extremely easy. Whatever you do do not buy the book.  It's a complete waste of money
Ridiculously easy.  It's like a kindergarten class, it's so easy it gets annoying.  Prof. is extremely disorganized which sometimes works in your favor.  If your looking for an easy class with absolutely no challenge, then this is your best bet
SUCKED
She is so nice and very easy! She will always help and you never have to go to class. Many discussions and a couple of papers, easy A.
she is so nice and i get to express my opinions
Very nice and very easy!!!!  Take class at all costs!  GPA booster!!!
Easiest class i have ever taken. It's almost pointless to go to class. Can turn stuff in late and also revise endlessly. Absolutely no papers.
great teacher, extremely nice, one of the easiest classes i have ever taken at this school..shes so cool that i wish i could make out with her on her magic carpet
the best teacher and easiest class you will take at this school...trust me","Students consistently mention that the class is easy, often with only a few papers and discussions required. However, some students also mention that the professor's disorganization can be frustrating and make it difficult to follow the syllabus. It's also noted that attendance may not be strictly enforced, but it's unclear if this will affect grades. Overall, it seems like this professor may be a good choice if you're looking for an easy class, but be prepared for a potentially disorganized experience."
571,"Not a good professor. The average on the midterm was a 42 and the highest grade was a 60. Wouldn't give us certain info needed to do projects, so you would be stuck unless you got it from someone else who got it from someone else who took the class before or unless you got it from the TA.
Class is useless, no point in going to lectures, stupidly high amounts of curving on exams. You will have no clue if you are going to get credit for the class until the class is over. Also way too strict about  lab sign up policies. Missed sign up once cause I didn't read the email in time and there was no chance to re sign up, 10% of grade gone.
Get ready to teach yourself because Davis cannot teach. During lectures, all he does is mumble and draw check marks and lines on the slides. Going to class is useless; you'll not be able to make sense of what he's saying. Learn to look for info in the HCS08 manual for the labs. Labs will  be your life. Open book and huge curve on final.
This class is terrible  1. make sure you know people that are good with C . 2 dont drop huge curve.
This could have been a very interesting class, had it been taught by somebody else. All Davis does is talk about the labs, so going to class is almost useless. Even though the exams are heavily curved, they are really hard and do no pertain to the labs, which are the only thing he lectures about.
Davis is an extremely boring professor. Lectures on and on and on about things that do not necessarily pertain to the entire focal point of the class (the projects), then hen he realizes that most of the class is completely lost he proceeds to basically show exactly how to do the projects. Is this teaching? Midterm and final are hard, but curved.
Cares about students, but doesn't really show it.  Lectures are extremely boring and don't help too much with the actual class.  Exams are so hard to a point that they shouldn't be valid but massively curved.  Not a great teacher.
amazing
Got a 29% on the midterm, didnt answer 3/8 of the final, got a B-. Nuff said.
One word: curve! Thats all you need to know. His test are hard as hell but you'll learn alot and the test scores dont matter too much
DO NOT GO TO THIS PROFESSOR FOR HELP. He does not seem willing at all to help his students. He is an OK at teaching the material, but do not try to go to him for help. The class is very hard.
Midterm: 32/100 Projects 35/100 Final: 10/100  Final grade:   C-  If you have to take this class don't let it scare you when you fail everything. I put about 10 hours into this course was almost **** myself thinking I was going to fail.  Curve is insane, you cant fail!  What else is there to s
Material gets really hard about 5/8 of the way through the semester.  Black box labs past lab 3 are impossible, but do a little work and the TAs will probably give you a lot of partial credit.  Sexy curves on the midterm and final.
Going to class is a waste because the material is explained a lot better in the book. Has a mono-tone voice that'll put you to sleep. You're expected to do labs on uncovered material, and my TA is a jerk who doesn't know what he's doing, and doesn't try to help, even in office hours.
Boring class. Don't understand why CISC majors have to take this when we take MATH210, CISC260, CISC301, and CISC360. Nothing but redundancy and uselessness here. Luckilly I had wireless access and was able to get real work done during lecture.
Alittle on the boring side but you learn A LOT!!! I liked him a lot. Just go to class and takes notes because you can use them on tests.
Terrible class and really hard. The projects were ridiculous, but luckily my TA was mad chill and always gave us 8s. Why do they make CISC majors take this again?
doesn't really matter cuz hes the only CPEG202 professor.  This guy can't teach. very unorganized.  However, does give huge curves, got 56 on midterm and final and still managed w/ a A-.  never go to him for help.  makes cpeg a really hard class.
i still have no idea what CPEG is or what the hell i am supposd to do about it but i got a C so im good.
Pretty easy class. Got a 50 on both midterm and final and still pulled out a B. Going to class doesn't really help. Also, spent lots of time on the black box, but only got one working.","The labs were challenging but that the TAs were helpful in providing partial credit. There were also comments about the professor being unorganized or unapproachable, but some students appreciated his teaching style. Overall, it seems like the class might require a lot of self-study, and success may depend on individual strengths and resources, such as having access to helpful TAs or classmates."
572,"This class ruined my life. Take this class only if you hate your GPA.
Lectures were boring, as were the 3 books assigned to read. 300 pages about inventing the wheel were just too many, as were the other books page counts. Theres only 2 exams and a 10-page paper. Hard to tell whats important and whats not during his lectures, making studying difficult. The course is not worth the effort required to do well in it.
It was scary that only the midterm and the final would result in your final grade, but he usually curves the exams grades AND offers 3 extra credit options that can raise your grade so much. The terms he releases on sakai before the exams are a very large portion of what will be tested. Awesome guy who loves what he does and pretty funny too.
Roe is one of my favorite professors at UD, you will learn a lot from his class if you pay attention. Do the extra credit and study hard for the two exams and you will be fine.
This class was interesting but extremely boring at times. A lot of the material he covers isn't even on the exam! I came to class all the time and always took notes for the first exam and barely got a passing grade. 2 exams 50% each with extra credit. I got A's in all my other classes and barely passed this class.
Do not make eye contact. Do not start a conversation. At all cost avoid stepping foot into his classroom. Teacher ruined my life. The city of newark would benefit if he were't around to teach anymore
Definitely avoid at all cost. Class is so boring and he just rambles on and on. Lots of assignments and he's all over the place. Overall the worst class I've taken so far.
Only 2 exams which are pretty hard given the material... He rambles in class and there are several required readings... Hard to tell what is pertinent and what isn't. Seems like a nice guy, but pass on this class unless you really need it.
Roe is a great guy. Always 100% enthusiast about the subject. This class was nice because there was only 2 exams w study guide and extra credit optional. Study the guide day before and do well. 2 books that aren't so bad, i just read summaries.
Try not to take this class. It can be interesting at times, but it is impossible. 2 hard exams and a 10-12 page research paper. Avoid this class. At all costs.
Nice enough guy, knows what he's talking about but he's a space case. It's almost impossible to comprehend the things he says. 10 page paper and 2 tests. Do the extra credit and the assigned reading, it'll make the class easier.
I would not recommend taking Roe at all. Only grades are 50% midterm and 50% final. He is disorganized and rambles in class. We had a textbook and 4 ethnographies to read. If you end up in this class do all the extra credit because it will save your grade. He does curve which is good though. But not an easy breadth requirement.
Classes are interesting, tests are harder than needed. Says he doesnt ask trivia but questions are in trivia form so its confussing. Offers extra credit that can help. Random questions from the readings that y wouldnt expect which makes studying pretty hard.
If you are taking Roe for a breadth requirement, it is NOT an easy A.  You MUST go to class and there are only 2 assignments he bases your grade off of so if you mess up it screws up your whole average.
Most interesting class I've taken at UDel, also the most impossible. His tests are confusing in that he uses terminology only he understands. You will be fascinated and think you're learning a lot in class only to be dumboundead on the exams even if you write down everything and study. Write a good research paper; only chance to boost your grade.
His classes are interesting, however, the exams are impossible. He is very helpful when it comes to writing the essay though. I went to his office and he literally told me everything I needed to know to write my paper. Good guy, ridiculously hard teacher
Quirky guy who wears cowboy boots and turquoise belt buckles. Definitely knows his stuff! Can't stress enough how important lecture notes are tho.. the entirety of the exams is from class. GO TO CLASS or else you'll miss so much. Probably could get by without books. He talks about them in class anyway.
Roe is awesome, but you shouldn't take his class.  The lectures were interesting, but had a hard time staying awake.  You will never know when his notes are something you should know.  only grades: 2 tough exams that you don't review and a huge vague research essay that the class won't prepare you for.  Won't read email, can't use internet research
He is a very nice guy. I probably would have done better in the class if I were more engaged in the material. His lectures are disorganized as he tends to ramble; I think this may be b/c he knows so much stuff and loves what he studies/teaches.
This class was definitely interesting. However, that is probably the only good part. The tests were hard and you only have two exams, a research paper and two extra credit opportunities. Definitely read the books and attendance is MANDATORY if you want to do well. He's pretty disorganized always late to class! I would NOT recommend him AT ALL.","There are only two exams and a research paper, which make up the bulk of the grade, and that it can be difficult to determine what is important from the lectures. Some students recommend doing the extra credit and reading the assigned books, while others feel that the exams are confusing and impossible to pass. Some students find Professor Roe to be disorganized and hard to follow, while others appreciate his enthusiasm for the subject. Overall, it seems that taking Professor Roe's class is a risky proposition, with some students enjoying it and others struggling to keep up."
573,"The class is an easy A if you just read the books. Attendance is mandatory. You have to read the books every week or you will not be able to catch up. The books are interesting and she is a very fair grader.
Most wretched class I have ever taken at UDel.  I came from ENGL341, hoping to further my knowledge and interest in American Lit, but I ended up not even bothering to show up-- and when I did, I was reminded of how useless the class was.  She read the text back to us and made us read from our journals, and constantly asked, ""Isn't it funny?"" AWFUL!
This woman is a HORRIBLE teacher. She interupts you when you try to speak in class about silly things like if you are in your assigned seat. How old are we, 12? She bases her class on having people read from their reading journals, but doesn't really have much of a discussion going on. Confused 24/7. You don't want her as a prof at all!
OMG.. if she doesnt understand there are different kinds of writing out there... do not take it if you are not an english major
OMG she is too old to be teaching. so boring! She gets people in the books confused and always asks ""isnt that so?"" in a way that seems like she isnt even sure herself. your opinion can be wrong if it doesnt match hers. makes alot of sense right? avoid if possible. Its easy to get good grades but you have to go to class and its painfully boring.
Dont take unless you are an english major.  Expects you to write a paper after each class, exams are essays, has assigned seating
You'd be safer not taking this class. Old-school English prof who hasn't moved along with the times. Not a really hard grader, but it seems like she's trying too hard to be clever with her comments on my essays. Just teach me how to write, please. Wit and $2.00 will get you a large cup of coffee at Starbucks. Not evil, just impatient.
Probably not the best choice for those looking to simply fulfill requirements.  If you are interested in great novels and are a good writer you will do fine.  Depending on your ability you probably don't need to read the books, but she makes it very clear you need examples from the books in your essay.  Definately lost at times, but knows her stuff
Good discussion... not great book selections.  In the end, an easy A.
Don't be turned away by a green face.  She prefers lecturing and class discussion, so that's how the class is ran.  If attendance weren't necessary, you could skip every class and pass.  There's 2 exams and a paper.  She gives good grades as long as you use the text to back your answers.  Don't read books, read spark notes. easy a
What a waste of my time!  Her discussions were anything but stimulating, and we spent most of the semester reading outloud from the book instead of analyzing what the novels were about.  An easy class, but so boring.
sure she is a bit eccentric, but that keeps things interesting. having to read 2 papers in front of the class was not fun, but no big deal. i liked going to her class 3x a week and she was really helpful and supportive with my writing. it is great how she thinks every book is beautiful and i loved how tattered and used all her books were
A bit boring at times and definitely losing her bearings on life, but she can be witty and is not afraid to talk about weird topics like the Clinton sex scandal.  If you attend class and are familiar with the topics discussed in class, you can do well without reading the books cover to cover.  Put in some effort and you will be fine.
Perhaps too advanced  in scope for most undergrads, who find her ""boring""; my recommendation for them: change your major to business. One should consider himself or herself lucky to find a professor who listens to students' opinions and is absolutely passionate about her discipline. She a great woman with a wealth of knowledge to share--be patient.
Isn't she great?  Isn't she wonderful?
She's a nice lady and means well, but do not take a class with her.  It was a waste of my time to attend 3 hours every week.
possibly the worst class to take at UD...nice enough lady but if something is wrong with your essay(s) she'll chew you apart
Boring teacher with an awful personality.  I would rather wait an extra semester to graduate than take a Safer class I needed to finish on time.
awful professor, awful class... waste of time and she makes you feel like crap for not writing the best paper in the history of the world","The class may be best suited for students who are interested in the subject matter and are willing to put in effort to keep up with the weekly readings and assignments. Attendance is mandatory, and the professor expects students to use examples from the books in their essays. It's also worth noting that some students find the professor's personality and teaching style to be eccentric or off-putting."
574,"Love the prof but the class was impossible. Only graded by three exams 
Rocek is a passionate professor with a good sense of humor, who does his best to make a boring topic interesting. However, his class is graded by 3 tests and nothing else, and the sheer volume of information covered between these tests makes them very tough to study for. As a class, midterm 1 and 2 required a 19% and 22% curve for the class to pass
I took ANTH204 with Dr. Rocek and had an alright time in the course. He grades easily, and has a bunch of assignments throughout the course to complete. The biggest assignments are a mini proposal paper, and the final exam. Overall I appreciate him as a professor, but did not learn much from his lectures as they can be quite boring. 
Lectures very heavy, which is fine, but covers a lot of material in a very short time. Attendance isn't taken but for your own sake attend class because he doesn't have any online resources. Grade is only 2 exams + long sem paper.  A lot of ""required"" readings but you can get by skimming or not doing some of them if you focus in lecture.
good prof, just a ton of stuff to remember. he doesn't post his lectures, and doesn't always go from the book so it was a bit confusing for me. only grades are exams. he is very nice and is super funny.
Great professor whos clearly passionate. A bit difficult for 100 level class but if you ask a question hell explain until you 100% get it. Only grades are exams which are multiple choice. He does record the lectures if you miss them but the quality isnt great. As long as you pay attention in lectures and ask questions when needed youll be fine.
Prof is great and clearly enjoys his field. Only grades are 3 exams which are based on lectures and the textbook (older versions will work). Attendance isn't taken but the lectures aren't posted to watch outside of class. No canvas page or online resources; you're mostly on your own. Overall a good class if you put in the work.
Really nice guy. If you like anthropology take this class. You mainly read the textbook and listen to lecture, no homework other than the reading, which means that you've got to do good on the exams, but he does give extra credit opportunity upfront.
Prof rocek makes bio-anth pretty easy to understand, just go to class and take notes and the exams will be fine! The exams (3- the last was a cumulative final) are open note AND curved. His lectures make sense and he'll always answer questions. Plus- he's pretty funny. Not too bad for an anth requirement!
While the content is quite challenging and there are few grading opportunities up front, Rocek is an extremely nice guy and will give you further grading opportunities if you ask for them. Its definitely not an easy A, but fostering a good relationship and open communication is very much your friend.
Prof. Rocek is an extremely nice person but his class was awful. He is intelligent and knowledgeable, but it was far too difficult. The ONLY grades all semester are three exams, so if you bomb one, you're pretty much screwed. The exams are very challenging so he always has to curve them. I do not recommend taking just for group D credit.
Hardest intro class I've ever taken, this is not an intro level course. DO NOT take if its not for your major. I am an anthropology major and I am even failing it. The tests are extremely hard and there's only three. If you want to study for hours and hours and still fail an exam, this is the class for you.
Very nice prof but class difficult even though level 100. Hard to pay attention and take accurate notes on. His notes dont have a lot of content so you NEED to listen and write down what he says. 3 exams, no other grades. Grades curved. Up to 1/2 final letter grade in extra credit available. Do not recommend if just taking for breadth. Buy book.
Took Professor Rocek's Anth104 class for an easy group D class and it turned into easily the most enjoyable class of my semester. He is quite lecture heavy, but always makes sure to answer student questions, regardless of what they're about. Highly recommend if you enjoy the subject matter of the class.
Rocek is a prof who truly wants his students to do well in his class. I enjoyed most of the lectures although they can get boring. Took the class to meet a requirement and this is the perfect class to do so for students who know how to study. Review your class notes and learn vocab in the chapters and you're golden. 
Professor Rocek is cool.  Sometimes he moves fast in lectures but always makes a point of leaving time for questions. Definitely expects you to read and does test on info that was in the book but not in his lectures. Likes to make jokes and puns, sometimes even in test questions, which helps make things more interesting. Overall a good professor.
He is such a nice person, but I would not choose to take this class if I could do it all over. His tests are ridiculous for an intro class! Your grade is based on 3 exams so you really have to do well on them! He does curve the grade and that is a life saver. Make sure you stay awake in the class to take notes as it can get really boring at times.
Not bad gave tremendous 10 point curves on all tests and curves your final average at the end
I took his People and Culture of the Southwest class (which is clearly his love). Our class had less than 10 people which was really nice. I personally enjoyed class, and never missed one. He gets VERY excited about his topic, and expects his students to share the same zeal. Better come interested or you'll find yourself miserable with the work.
I'm a senior, and I've rarely seen any class that demanded this amt of info recall. Prof is a sweetheart, but unclear. Final should NOT be cumulative! Students that love bio/arch usually love this class. If you don't, it will be really tough. That said, his handouts are KEY; use them to organize the info or it's totally overwhelming.","The exams challenging and needed significant studying to pass. However, he is known to curve grades, and some students appreciated the opportunity for extra credit. Some also found his lectures boring, but others enjoyed his humor and willingness to answer questions. Overall, it seems that students who put in the effort to attend lectures, take notes, and study diligently can do well in his classes."
575,"Do not take Grubbs course. It is all his own research, there is no real textbook, the exams are free response questions which are very vague. You can show up to class, take valuable notes, meet with him, and you will still fail. His ego is to high and after the first exam (which 90% of the class failed), he said ""I will fail you, idc""
Buddy is an absolute loser and arguably the worst professor in the business college. He talks like he is the man but in reality is a nobody and teaches a garbage class with useless content. Have to tailor exam answers to what he thinks is right. The curriculum is his own research which could all be made up. No real evidence to anything he says. 
One of the worst professors at this school - avoid if you can. Your grade is based on 3 exams which you won't pass unless you memorize these random graphs and drawings which he literally makes up and are based on nothing. He is also just an unfriendly and rude person, and the slides he goes off of in class are handwritten and completely illegible.
Dont let others fool you, Grubb is funny and a real nice guy. Hes very relaxed and if you participate and communicate hes very understanding. His lectures do get a little long and excessive, but if you get core concepts his papers and exams are an easy A. 10/10 would get a drink with
Just don't. There are far better professors in the economics department.
Professor Grubb's lectures were him just reading off scanned notes he had prepared beforehand. The notes were illegible and he never followed the textbook so it was impossible to do any studying/reading outside of the lectures. Professor Grubb graded off of weekly problem sets that he never gave any personal feedback or review of. No exams.
Grubb is hilarious&kind. However, he lectures off of scanned hand written notes that are hard to follow. He likes to push students to think on their own, so his weekly problem sets were very difficult because it applied theories in ways you haven't seen before. No individual feedback, but he really gets you to think about the material and apply it.
Farley honestly cares more about the course content than his own students. We only had weekly papers and were not given any individual feedback. If you have to take the class its not super hard, but you really have to take good notes if you want to do well on papers. You won't get by just summarizing notes, he wants details of things he said too.
This class was horrible. His lectures are confusing and unorganized, and you have to put so much work in outside of class to even have a small chance of success. 0/10 would recommend. Success is possible but at the cost of your sanity.
5 books-5 short critical analysis essays-10% each. Final is 50% & just reiterating things from class. His average is usually a B or C and he's helpful in office hours. Kinda odd but that's typical for experienced economists. He won't fail you unless you're legitimately dumb, but it's hard to not pull at least a B- in this class. Good upper lvl req.
This was Grubb's first time teaching the class since the 90s. While I think Grubb would be a good professor for higher level courses, he seemed to assume we already had a basic knowledge of economics, and many things were left unexplained. Notes were unorganized and scrambled. However, office hours for problem set questions were helpful.
He isn't very personable which makes going to him after class for help tough. He gives 6 papers, 10% of your grade each, final take home paper 40%. Tough grader. Nails you hard for very stupid things including citing things right, but end of the year curve is very clutch. You won't fail, but an A is tough. Papers are tricky to determine how to do..
The class is a complete bell curve.  I love his teaching style and the material is really cool, but it does require a ton of memorization.  I didn't do any external reading and got an A-.  Best way to get an A:  MEMORIZE YOUR NOTES.  It's tedious, but just look over them every now and then to keep fresh.  Entire grade based on 3 exams, great class.
The scrub below this is just upset he got a bad grade. Honestly this class is easy if you can memorize you're notes. He grades on a proper bell curve which students do not understand anymore because of grade inflation. This class isn't for everyone but if you are willing to study and show up to class it isn't anything difficult.
Grubb's class structure and grading system is both fickle and absurd. Has an obsession over obscure facts which leaves students out to dry on tests (essay format). Doesn't communicate well and comes off as condescending in office hours. Overall class was a nuisance and 50% of students received a C or below. Should say something about his character.
It's nerve wracking that your only grade is 3 exams, but it's easy to get an A. If you take good notes during lecture and memorize them using graphs and knowing how to explain concepts you'll be fine. He grades based on how the rest of the class does, and there were a few kids that get 5 out of 30's on exams. 20 to 23 out of 30 per exam is an A
Going to class is not mandatory but everything that is taught in class will be on the exam. Very helpful during office hours and will go over the material with you. Exams are straight forward and  the grades on exams are based on the class performance.
Prof Grubb really loves this topic, which automatically makes super dry material seem more interesting. His critical essays are tough, but it really makes you look at books/other writing in a whole new way. Go to class- there's a 40% cumulative final at the end that's only from class lectures, and it's all essay based/free response. Good Luck.
The only way to do well in his class is to show up and take good notes. He is a difficult professor and super unhelpful out of class time, but if you like history at all the lectures aren't too boring. And exams are just regurgitation of facts. The whole grade is 3 exams that are non cumulative 
One of the most poorly taught courses I've taken at the university.  Grubb puts in very little effort to teach- he lectures on subjects but fails to engage anyone.  Assignments include 6 critical essays that he doesn't prepare you for and grades harshly, stressing that he doesn't want 'book reports.'  Also a ridiculous exam worth 40% of grade.","Some students find him to be a good professor, while others find him difficult to work with. Some students also found the course content to be interesting, while others found it to be difficult and disorganized. It seems that the exams are the main source of grading, and some students feel that they are difficult and based on obscure facts. Overall, it may be a good idea to gather more information about the course and Professor Grubb before deciding whether or not to take his class."
576,"Absolutely fantastic lecturer, extremely helpful office hours. Doesn't grade attendance but it's critical. WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING HE SAYS! You'll get a B on the first quiz (weekly) and As on the rest. Readings are not strictly necessary, they're only 30% of the three exams, and even then you can ace those sections w/out reading anything, like I did!
There is a reasonable amount of work considering this was an honors colloquium class. There were weekly readings and three fairly short research papers. Make sure to participate actively as it comprises half of your grade. Professor Sidebotham is a very tough grader, but he is just as helpful and interesting as he is tough.
Professor Sidebotham gave amazing lectures about topics that would otherwise seem boring. However, participation was a big part of the grade for this Honors colloquium class. The grading criteria for papers wasnt really apparent until after the first rough draft was already graded, but always helps out with corrections.
Quizzes are manageable if you are willing to memorize large volume of terms. Scores on tests do not correlate with how well you do on quizzes. 6 essay prompts handed out a week before your essay exam. You get 2 of them random and must spit back every single term that relates or you lose a point. Unrealistic expectations on these essay exams.
Attendance not mandatory but you will not pass if you skip. Weekly quizzes, so you need to put work in to study. A lot of reading. Fair grader with good feedback. Incredibly inspiring and such a smart man, his lectures are interesting, funny, and full of information.
Sidebotham is absolutely great. He is passionate, knows his stuff, engages with his students, and an absolute gem of a teacher. I love history, but I don't enjoy reading extensively. You will need to read quite a bit. He doesn't take attendance, but missing lectures is bad for your grade, but also because you miss out on such great content in class
He can be quite disorganized in the way he presents the materials. He seems to expect us to absorb more than he says/presents in class. I also find him to be condescending which I don't find particularly endearing.
I loved this class! There are difficult weekly quizzes, but only if you don't pay attention & don't study. They help on the exams. Do the readings - it'll hurt if you don't. I learned so much & Sidebotham brought in POVs that aren't conventionally taught. He spent a lot of time in the regions studied & it shows through photos on PP slides.
Loved the lectures, very knowledgeable and very inspiring. Great Prof.  The issue is he will find a term in the fine print and expect you to know. If you are not concerned about your GPA than take it but if you are looking to increase your GPA do not take it. 3/4 of the class withdrew from the class. It was a horrible.
I put more work into this class than I have in any other class in my 4 years and I got my worst grade ever. Wrote over 30 pages, he grades a ""rough draft"" & a final paper. His comments on my rough draft barely helped me improve my grade on the final, if there were more things he wanted improved he could've said so. But WWII material was interesting
He's  a fantastic lecturer who manages to be both clear and interesting even when talking about sometimes dry topics. His tests are tough, but he makes sure you have all the material you need to do well, so long as you don't underestimate them. As a warning: His essay questions are graded purely on content, write everything you can on a subject.
He lectures very well. If you have any love for history you need to take one of his upper levels. He is straightforward and tells you exactly what he wants; he even gives you the test essay topics before hand. Quizzes are every Friday, so just do the readings and you will own it.  One hell of a lecturer, highly recommend Ancient Rome.
Interesting course, learned a lot, especially because I have History minor, however EXTREMELY METICULOUS. Exams are CHALLENGING and require many hours of reading various documents and books. Text use is heavy and hard to read, plus it is hard to tell what he expects you to get from readings. VERY DETAIL ORIENTED. quizzes every Friday, lectures well
Challenging class that will teach you a lot about an interesting subject.  I think I learned more in this course than any other I've taken.  As long as you put a couple of hours a week in to do the reading and study, you'll be fine.
I thought this class was very interesting. if you stay on top of the work he gives you its really not that bad. you just have to be good at memorizing a lot of terms. if you aren't someone who can listen to a history lecture and take notes without zoning out then this isn't the class for you.
Sidebotham is incredibly well versed in the subject matter of that course. If you go to class, ask questions, DO THE READINGS, and go to office hours with any questions, you'll pass. He's very helpful, I changed my grading to P/F and passed with his help. He tells you exactly what he wants on exams and all of it is in the readings/covered in class.
I got an A-, his class is super easy if you just do the busy work required. Like there is absolutely nothing required from you other than to just spit the terms from lecture back out dring thetest. USE A RECORDER... it saved my life!
His is a great professor who is fascinated with his material. His exams are difficult but he is the only teacher who tells you EXACTLY what he wants on the exams and the readings are a must. His lectures are old school slides so class attendance is necessary but its also fun. He is a funny guy who will try to help you if you aren't doing well.
I actually took Dr. Sidebotham's class in the 1990s.  I've never worked so hard for a D+, but it was STILL the most interesting class I've EVER taken. I agree he is difficult, but if this is what you're interested in, this guy is the one to take the classes with. After further education on my part, I have a very serious appreciation for his talent.
This guy is an amazing teacher. He absolutely knows everything about what he teaches. BUt he is a very hard grader, and his quizzes and exams are hard. You need to study! He doesn't put power points up, so be ready to take notes. and no matter what, ALWAYS RIGHT DOWN THE TERMS ON THE BOARD! its very important to passing his class.","The courses require a significant amount of reading and memorization, and the exams are challenging. Some students feel that Professor Sidebotham's grading is tough and that he can be disorganized, condescending, or too detail-oriented. Attendance is not mandatory, but students who skip classes tend to do worse. Overall, the courses seem to be interesting and informative, but they require effort and dedication."
577,"this was the second class I took with Dr. Miller and I love her. There are discussion posts that are so easy but sometimes time-consuming depending on how long the film is you have to watch, lots of readings, and the exam questions were kind of hard but nothing extreme. two papers: one based on a book and one research paper. take her if u can!!!!
The exams were a little tricky, but doable. The writing assignments were not difficult, but they require you to think and get ahead of it, so you're not behind. The main issue for me was that you won't get full points if your answer wasn't something she could agree with herself. The exams are based on the textbook so it requires you to read a lot. 
I absolutely love Dr. Miller. She is by far the best professor I've had at UD. I've taken two of her classes. This class has discussions, two exams that are kinda hard but doesnt drag your grade down too much &a paper based on a book from a list she gives. I would def recommend her! So sweet but don't walk into class late that's her one pet peeve. 
The work load was pretty average and made sense, but everything pretty harshly and lectures were so boring. The material is also super heavy like I have cried due to the material multiple times so really be prepared for that
I love this professor! The class was asynchronous and was one of the best asynch classes I've taken. She doesn't grade harsh and as long as you relate back to the readings you'll get full points. The material is very interesting and she gives you a creative option for one of the papers. The midterm was easy, but make sure you do her study guide!
Dr. Miller is a wonderful professor. She is extremely educated on subjects concerning Violence Against Women and Criminal Justice. She put me in touch with other professors within her department and actually helped me decide to declare a second major. 10/10
second writing course, 2 exams, one big paper that is broken into multiple parts, she is super sweet and actually wants her students to do well, second time taking her and she is great!
AVOID her unless you absolutely can't. Super strict about attendance and being on time. Does not use canvas at ALL, not even to post grades. No powerpoints for notes, just her talking. Exams were very difficult, they are written/mc. No extra credit or ways to bring your grade up. Only 3 exams and paper. Can't miss more than 1 class. Way too hard.
There are 3 exams, which can be tricky. Uses all of the above. None of the above. Both a and b. Etc... But if you go to class (which is mandatory) and do the readings you'll be fine. Also, a research paper on a book of your choice. Makes you work for it, but it's totally worth the effort.
There are only 2 papers. And you have to go to class to pass. But it's not difficult. Watch a movie each class.
This class is very interesting and do-able. If you put in some work and seek help if necessary you will do well. There is a research paper and an exam that focuses on both lectures and the readings (she gives out study guides.) Overall,and an extremely knowledgeable professor who really cares about the material and her students.
This is my 3rd class with Dr. Miller & I loved it. Since this class counts towards A&S second writing, you should expect to do more work than other classes. There's 1 paper, which is due in increments throughout the semester, 2 exams & a group project, in which you must read a book. Make sure to show up on time to class and to participate!
Forewarning: there are topics that are difficult to listen to in lecture, BUT once you get through those topics, it gets better, trust me! She gives good feedback on the paper you have to write & offers extra credit on each exam. She also gives you a study guide 1 week prior to exam & you should use this to study. Also, take good notes.
I took this class during winter session and despite the class only being 5 weeks long, the pace of the class was perfect. There were no exams, but there were 2 papers. If you have any questions about the papers, don't hesitate to email her or to go see her during her office hours. She give good feedback and really want her students to succeed.
If you show you care, she'll really go out of her way to help you out. Her tests are straight-forward and pretty easy as long as you pay attention in class. You'll need to do the readings to get an A, otherwise expect a B. I would definitely take a class with her again. 
By far one of the best teachers I've ever had. She is really nice, and gives out good feedbackextra credit. If you are a struggling student like I was she will help you get your grade back up. She is worth your time going to class.
Loved Susan in the past and loved this class as well! This is my best class! Never read the text (you do need it for study guide), did the study guides, got an A on the exam. Everything on guide is on exam! Paper is easy if you do what she asks. Not an easy A for those not interested, I think it is easy but the topics are my bread & butter.
Exams a tricky. Uses many ""all of the above"" / ""none of the above"" questions! 3 exams and 1 paper. No extra credit was offered to our class. She is helpful and attendance is mandatory.
Honestly miller is a horrible teacher. She is overly feministic and this is coming from a girl. And her grading is just ridiculous. No room to write any way but hers for papers. Do not take this professor. She's nice but her classes are far too annoying.
CRIME & JUSTICE IN FILM & LITERATURE: This class was ok. the films chosen seemed to be more sociological than they were criminological. she made no effort to get to know anyone's names and there were less than 20 of us. not too hard of a grader. i felt like i learned a lot, but again, i have to emphasize that she made no personal connection.","Dr. Miller is a knowledgeable and caring professor who assigns a moderate workload. Her exams may be tricky but doable, and attendance is mandatory. She also seems to be a fair grader who gives good feedback. Some students find her lectures to be boring or the material to be heavy, but others find the material interesting and engaging. Overall, it seems like students who put in effort and participate in class should do well in her courses."
578,"Professor Heyrman is a very nice lady and is very knowledgeable about history. Attendance isn't mandatory but is required to take her pop up quizzes. The pop quizzes are worth a big percent of your grade and if you aren't good with pop quizzes I wouldn't recommend this class because if you do bad on the quizzes it really affects your grade.
She may seem strict at first, but if you really engage with the materials, take good notes, and participate in class (especially in book discussions), it's really an awesome course. Also, all pop quizzes are open-note & there are 10 throughout the semester. I would recommend this class, but warning it is a bit of a harder introductory course. 
I took this course thinking it would be interesting and it was, but it was so difficult for no reason. The pop quizzes were frequent and difficult. Make sure you're always paying attention and taking good notes because she moves super fast. You don't even start talking about the Civil War until the last few days. The papers are long and hard too.
I did not enjoy taking this class at all, if you don't need it don't take it. Many class discussions and she will call on anybody whether or not you offer to participate. Lots of readings are required and there's pop quizzes usually at least once a week. Also not many assignments, just quizzes and two big papers. 
She has no interest in helping you or seeing you succeed. She grades for this intro course like it's at an advanced level and does not provide support for students with disabilities. When I asked for support for my disability, she wrote me an email back telling me that she'd done as much as she was going to, and not to ask for her help again.
This class was pretty boring, but professor Heyrman was an easy grader and all your grade is 3 essays, just make sure you actually read and you will be fine
Do not take this class
awful
I repeatedly asked for help with the course. Not only was she rude and dismissive, but offered me no resources or assistance (despite me taking this course out of pure interest). I'm not sure why she teaches unless it is for research purposes, because it does not seem like she is there for the students or has any interest in helping them to learn.
There are only a total of 3 grades for the class. You have 3 essays. There is no text book so you only have the lectures to go from. If you do horrible on the first exam you only have 2 more chance to boost you grade. She reads from a script and often skips around topic which makes it hard to follow along. I would not take this class again.
The 3 essay exams are easy if you go to lectures and take good notes. Very passionate about the topic and can answer any questions. The essay exams are not too bad, reviewed 85% on both so far. Expected to read but unlikely she will find out if you read or not. Not worth getting the books, can look up online.
Christine only gives 3 exams for the semester and thats your entire grade. Each exam is 3 essays that she grades HARD on. Her PowerPoints dont explain topics well so if you miss class, you wont do good on your exam. I wish we had more opportunities to get our grade up because if you do bad on one or two essay exams, your grade is screwed
While she's super nice, all Heyrman does is lecture. That's it. She reads off a script and most of the information isn't on the slides. The only grades are 3, 7 page essays. She does quite a few discussions based off assigned readings. If you don't read them, don't even come to class because she will call on you whether you raise your hand or not.
the class is based on 3 papers which definitely makes passing hard, I believe you also get a few points for participating in discussions. Christine is a nice lady, super quiet, definitely sit towards the front. go to lectures ! if you miss one its so hard to catch back up if you miss one. there are 3 books, you don't really need to read them
Only recourses you can use for your papers are the lectures she assigned (2 per a week, each 1 hour) and the readings which are pages and pages. Only 5 papers and participation and the prompts are sometimes hard to understand. Wouldnt take her class again.
grades very few things so it is hard to make up for a poor grade. Lots of outside of class learning but great at answering any and all questions when you need help. Very passionate about history but it can get confusing when there are topic jumps that she knows about but students might not.
When the online transition occurred the quizzes were removed making both the midterm and final half each of the total grade and participation would be extra credit. However, barely talked about the actual civil war despite the course description saying otherwise.
Midterm and final are both essays around 10 pages. No other assignments but if you participate she'll bump your grade up. Classes are heavily discussion based, she calls on everybody so do the readings, its a lot sometimes but doable. When we switched to online classes she didn't change the class at all and expected the same kind of participation.
Christine is the best! She really cares about the students and wants all of us to succeed. The only grades are 2 really long papers and participation. Definitely attend class and take good notes. Participation is definitely encouraged and keeping up with the readings is helpful. Not a very tough grader. A hard class, but an A is very possible!
She is one of the nicest people you will meet. Her lectures are so entertaining and she always makes sure that everyone is understanding what she is saying. Couple pop quizzes but they usually come after any reading we had the night before ( there aren't many). Definitely so nice and definitely worth taking the class to fill a requirement.","Professor Heyrman's class is quite challenging, with a heavy emphasis on pop quizzes and a few long papers that make up the majority of the grade. The class is discussion-based, with lots of required readings. Some students find Professor Heyrman to be knowledgeable and helpful, while others feel she is dismissive and uninterested in helping students. Attendance is recommended, as is active participation in class discussions."
579,"Dr. McClure is a very good instructor. As a student that wanted to continue their playing, but didn't want to make it their first priority, he made sure that I went at a comfortable pace. If there was a week where I was struggling with a particular element, he would go over class time to assist.
After playing in the orchestra for 4 years, I got real tired of him. He's generally nice enough, but the music he picks tends to be really boring or just does not sound good. He complains that we don't practice, but he gives us no incentive to do so.
Wonderful teacher, very wise musician and a fantastic conductor. His musical knowledge is breath-taking. Nice person and one of the best professors at TSU.
I had him for orchestra, lessons, and studio. I think he's misunderstood by people who aren't his full time students (AKA people who only have orchestra with him). While he doesn't really focus at all on the emotion of music, you'll really improve as far as technical things go. He seems genuinely interested in seeing his students learn.
4th year in orchestra. Great repertoire, terrible ensemble- mainly because there is gap in talent. The winds are solid; strings are all over-1st violin are great. McClure takes SLOW tempi, is boring, biased, and strict. Great musical exposure but little to learn from this stubborn man.
Had him for orchestra, studio, class.  Very closed-off person.  Kind enough, and amiable, but forgets that music involves a lot of emotion and not just mechanics.  He's great with mechanics, though.  Just don't expect to bond with him over how music makes you ""feel"".  If that doesn't matter to you, then he may be great for you.
wow, def. not a fan of Dr. McClure. He only does what he has to. He's boring, takes the SLOWEST tempos possible, and makes music annoying. I loved orchestra until I came here. He's weird and completely annoying. He's never said anything profound or inspirational. I hope we get a new orchestra director soon!
Dr. McClure is just insanely nice.  He doesn't yell or get angry in lessons, and occasionally says completely crazy things in orchestra (i.e. ""Don't rush or I'll kill you"").  Give a little effort and you're golden.
Dr. McClure is a good man who really tries his hardest... but the students are not always willing to give him the same respect he shows them.  I'm not so much disappointed with him but at the sour attitudes of the fellow musicians.  The literature is good, solid literature, and if you practice, it will make you a better musician.  Another problem i
He's a great source of entertainment and has done a lot for the orchestra.  However, his complacency with only the section leaders being able to play the music is extremely frustrating.  It's a huge waste of time when you just have to wait for everyone to catch up.  He won't get on people's cases for not practicing, which he needs to do.
This class is a waste of my time. The book he uses is biased, as is he. You go to class so he can tell you exactly what you read in the book the night before. He is disorganized and never really seems to know what is going on...nice man, though.
Who doesn't like Dr. McClure? He is so nice, and does so much to try and help students.
A very helpful individual.  Always has time in a busy schedule to help his students; is super-knowledgable about the violin as well as orchestra/conducting/arranging/etc.","He's generally nice enough, but the music he picks tends to be really boring or just does not sound good. Great musical exposure but little to learn from this stubborn man. He's boring. Dr. McClure is just insanely nice.  He doesn't yell or get angry in lessons"
580,"Truly awful person and teacher. Takes pleasure in demeaning and embarrassing students. Extremely full of himself, doesnt care about his students, assigns 25+ hours of homework per week, yet literally no one knows whats going on.
Boring and totally absolutely arrogant. He is in his own little world and doesn't like to deal with mere mortals.
Lectures straight from the book, but tries to make it more interesting.  Writes/grades the open book portion of the exam, which is easier than the closed book.  WAY TOO MUCH HOMEWORK.  There's a huge curve in the class so its not that hard to get a decent grade.
he is a hard teacher but helps one learn and understand the difficult material
He wont tell you the answer, but will question you until you find it for yourself.  Cheg342 is all about deriving from the model eqns, dont try to memorize every little case.
Teaches well but straight from the notes.  Sometimes hard, sometimes easy.
smug SOB but a good teacher; hw and tests hard; introduces u to toughness of maj
Hard but knows what he is doing, tests are way too hard,
at least he doesnt have low self esteem, ridiculous workload
Talks about his coffee cup wrt thermodynamics a lot.
Tough to learn the material cuz you do 10-15hrs of hwk a week.he's an ok guy
Made me feel like an idiot went I went to his office hours.
talks slow sometimes, knows a lot, tests are really hard
good prof, very smart
this cat is on an ego trip!
He taught while making everything interesting.  I liked him better than Lenhoff.
very smart, but i know nothing other than thermo is so ""powerful"". whatever","Boring and totally absolutely arrogant. Hard but knows what he is doing, tests are way too hard. WAY TOO MUCH HOMEWORK. ridiculous workload talks slow sometimes, knows a lot, tests are really hard Teaches well but straight from the notes."
582,"Paretta is the man. I took this class online and he's one of the only professors I've had that can still translate the classroom vibe via zoom, and the guy is like 85. If you're looking for an easy course, this isn't it. But, if you want to actually learn the material and come out prepared, look no further. Very exam heavy they make up your grade
In accounting you either get it or you don't. Dr. Paretta is a really good teacher for those who get it, but it's easy to get lost if you don't. The good thing about Dr. Paretta is hes always available by email for any questions, he really cares about his students, and gives out grading incentives and tries to help you along the way so no one fails
I think I would have liked this class if not for Paretta. You have to teach yourself everything because Uncle Bob won't, since he only teaches ""FYI"", non-tested material and tells you all about how accounting is a life of sex & danger. He is smart and knows alot, just doesn't seem to want to actually teach.
Uncle Bob is the man. If you're an accounting major, definitely take his class because you will come out so much more prepared than the other 207 classes. You need to follow his course guidelines if you want to do well, so be sure to take them seriously. He's also hilarious in class which makes learning accounting so much better. Highly recommend
Paretta is tough. If you're looking for an easy A look elsewhere, but if you want to learn there is no one better. You will know accounting better than anyone who took it with a different professor. He is a good teacher but the way his class is set up he will only help you if you ask for it. Quizzes do not count but take them seriously.
Paretta is a really nice guy,  funny, & he does care about the students. That being said, this class is entirely on you. Frustrating at times because 95% of the stuff you go over in class isn't on the exams.. calls it FYI. You will have to teach yourself the material, but you do learn a lot more by doing so. Tough class, worked my butt off for a B.
Incredible professor, truly wants and requires the best out of his students. Exams are difficult, but Uncle Bob is understanding and does everything in his power to help students out and prepare them. If you are planning on taking CPA in future, take Uncle Bob for Intermediate.
Paretta's a great guy with a good sense of humor. Just make sure you study diligently for all of the tests. The first exam is very easy and I figured it would be the same way for the second exam, and that mentality ended up hurting my final grade (still ended with a B).  Planning on taking 315H next year with him as my professional  elective.
Prof. Paretta is literally my favorite professor I've ever had at Udel. His class (at least Acct207 anyways) is not at all horrible as people have noted. Yeah he expects you to read the book but in all honesty there isn't much time for him to teach you in class. The project at the end of the semester is long but not too hard. He's also hilarious!
Best learning experience ever. Definitely requires consistent effort. I felt bad for the students that did not follow his directions for success in the class (he hands you a 3 page document on day 1 detailing how to succeed in the class). If you don't want to look like an idiot on the job when financial acctg comes up, take Paretta!!!
Worst professor I have ever taken. You are expected to read a 2000 page book 3 times through. He does not teach, he only goes over homework problems in class and then tells you how dumb you are if you get it wrong instead of helping understand. He slams everyone with the exams, after not having taught anything to us. DO NOT TAKE HIM
I took Paretta for ACC 316 in 1982, 31 years ago.   I scored in the 90s on all four parts of the exam.   I can remember specific things he said during the classes to this day.   YES, he is hard, but if you are serious about being successful in this profession you should take him.  You are entering a profession where 7 figure earnings are common.
avoid him if you can. final project is way too advanced for intro to accounting students and not helpful. I will have to relearn accounting principles in order to build a better foundation for my career. his grading is ok, doesn't use +/-, offers nice incentives but are tough to meet. if you take him, read the textbook plenty, and good luck.
Very nice, funny, and motivational. Expects unrealistic amount of time for this class, you have to teach yourself everything, b/c class is spent going over hw that you probably wont understand on your own. if you arent honors, DO NOT TAKE HIM because the other prof is so much easier and averages in this class are so much lower. hardest class at UD
""Uncle Bob"" is an excellent professor- very humorous and candid, keeps students engaged. While you could probably just learn from the book, his insights and connections in class are valuable. Final project challenging but very useful. Exams are not difficult if you prepare; offers ""incentive plan"" to improve grades.
Tough but SO worth it. You'll walk away with a thorough knowledge of not only how to read financial statements but also a good understanding of the individual components on them. Tests are tough but if you do the reading and work outside of class you'll reap the benefits, plus multiple chances to redeem yourself. FOLLOW THE PLAN and good luck!
Very difficult, but you will learn a lot. Very humorous, and will often apply concepts to real world situations. Classes are more of a supplementary tool. Main learning comes from reading the book. Read the book. Read it. Read the book and you will do well.
Probably one of the most entertaining professors I've ever had.  This guy actually manages to make accounting somewhat interesting.  Very humorous and respectful.  I would definitely recommend him.
Extremely hard tests that test on basically your knowledge of the accounting profession in nearly its entirety. Goes over little in class before slamming you with hard tests and takes off for just about anything that might be remotely off. Believes he is god to a class that everyone should work at for at least 10 hours a week and 2000 or more pages
Heavy dependance on book and extremely difficult tests. Deducts large amount of points for tiny mistakes. Cares about students, but isn't afraid to insult their intelligence in class (especially after a poor quiz). 90% of learned material you teach yourself. Expects you to devote most of your time to his class only (10 hour a week minimum).","You have to teach yourself everything Very difficult. Extremely hard tests. Expects unrealistic amount of time for this class. Exams are difficult. If you're looking for an easy course, this isn't it. Worst professor I have ever taken. Final project is way too advanced."
583,"His lectures are aimless and unclear a lot of times, but I would still recommend taking him.  The papers are short and he is an easy grader.  I put in minimal effort and received an A
Very knowledgeable about Brit Lit, a really nice man and if you really need an extension on an assignment he will give it to you. lectures were boring unfortunately but just read out of the textbook and you'll be money
He is a really nice guy, but is pretty unorganized in both thoughts and covering the material.  However, the class was pretty easy and required 5 short papers, 1 long paper, and 2 tests.
This is the dullest class you can take! Mell is a sweet man and cares about his students but his lecture leaves more to be desired.
DO NOT TAKE THE AGE OF SATIRE.. every class i went to i immediately regretted going.. paid more attention to the clock then what he was talking about.  should have retired years ago and wore the same belt everyday.  Bring word jumbles/crossword puzzles to pass the time
I felt like I was going to sleep and I'm one of the ones who was able to answer questions, the guy next to me played videogames on his cell phone.
Lectures are unfortunately boring, but he's definitely knowledgeable and intelligent, and obviously very nice. If you don't mind the lectures and do the readings, he doesn't seem like a very tough grader.
He talks to no one and does nothing to create any kind of class environment at all.  It was impossible to enjoy this class because I spent the entire time spacing out, which is a shame.
really, really, really boring. but an easy grader.
ugh! soooo boooring.  I like to consider myself a pretty well applied student, but when he starts to talk I feel like shooting myself, I think, ""do I really care anymore?""  This class was excruciating to go to, but I still did pretty well.  So if you don't mind driving yourself crazy every other day to get a decent grade, go for it.
ummm yea, went to class and slept.  good times.  B's for all
He seems like a really nice guy who is obviously very intelligent, but I had to drop this class because it was hard for me to follow his train of thought--he has so much to say but his thoughts seem unorganized and they tend to jump around a lot
Tough grader, but fair.  Knows his stuff.  Very willing to meet with students.
He tends to interrupt himself; Also, he can be pretty boring. But, he knows his stuff, gets you slightly more interested, and can bring up many aspects of satire you hadn't thought about before. Read the works, use his topics, and you'll be fine.
He really wasn't that bad and he truly knows his stuff. If you go to him with questions he'll help you. Yes, he is old and yes, he does love this topic so yes, it could be considered boring at times but I learned a lot. He's a pretty fair grader.
no no no.  boing, unfair and horrible teacher.
Fair grader, class is boring but he's a fair grader and knows what he's talking about. He's super helpful if you go to him with questions.
He's not that bad, yes the class is on the boring side, but I found him to be a fair grader.
This may be a class in satire, but theres nothing funny about this class. Boring & BEWARE!! the paper grades u get are the opposite of the effort u put in. 0 effort=A. 100% effort=C Lectures.....sometimes I feel like I walked into the wrong class.
He isn't that bad of a teacher. He is fairly easy if you read the material. However, my classmates were the strangest brew of college students ever assembled.","His lectures are aimless and unclear a lot of times. lectures were boring. his lecture leaves more to be desired.

586,"Great Professor and an easy A. The class is very group discussion based and I always enjoyed going to this class. Very fun and informative. 
Eugene wants you to succeed and learn. He's so sweet and such an easy professor to work with and will give you the grade you want if you choose to make your own syllabus. Everyone who goes to class chooses to be there because his lectures are interesting and useful for future teachers.
make your own syllabus and get an A :)
You can create your own syllabus and grade yourself if you choose, so this class is super easy. But, Eugene is very caring and class is super interesting if you choose to go
This class is super easy and Eugene is a great professor. The main project is very confusing, but not very hard to do, and attendance for class isn't mandatory which is nice because the class is 3 hours long. If you take this, choose an open or opening syllabus because with these there are no exams or papers and they're much easier.
Take for a multicultural requirement or breadth! The 2nd class we went over the course and you have options as to your syllabus, CHOOSE AN OPEN SYLLABUS. I literally wrote a paragraph or two on what I planned on doing in this class and stuck to it for the semester and was able to grade myself with an A! No hw, no exams, no attendance, still an A
Class structure is neat but confusing as students have the choice to make their own syllabus, follow a loosely guided syllabus, be a traditional student or take a B- and leave. Discussion based class where students pick the topics and workload depends on what syllabus you pick. I enjoyed coming to this class and learned a lot!
Such an easy A!!! take this class if you can. Its 3 hours long and if you create your syllabus like I did you never have to go and you can still get an unconditional A based off of what you want to learn. He really loves what he does and is super kind. Never did work outside of class.
There is no reason you shouldn't get an A in this class. Main project is very confusing though. Class has no exams or anything. Discussion based and you don't even have to participate. Only required to blog a little each week. Soo easy. Recommend as a breadth requirement definitely. Students can change rules and choose topics. Nice guy.
 Class was useless. All we did was define diversity topics, not explain how to fix them. MLP is extremely confusing. Ask questions early or you won't know what to do. USE PEER GRADERS! Do not let him grade your final project. Tough grader, which is ridiculous because the project has no rubric and no one knows what theyre doing. 
Eugene was awesome. No textbook, no tests. Its just a discussion and he always comes to class so prepared. He really is the sweetest man and just wants to educate everyone. We do online postings twice a week but they aren't hard. Have fun with it, he's hilarious!
I really enjoyed this class, it's a lot of discussion and as long as you attend the class you'll do fine.  There was a web component to the course that was easy to complete.  The final project is a bit intense, but as long as you put in effort and show improvement between your first and second drafts, you'll do well in the class.
Eugene is a really nice man, but it is often really hard to understand him. The class meets twice a week for an hour and fifteen min., and it really is a waste of time. We talk about interesting material, but we do nothing but discuss. No tests, but tons of online work! 6 hours of placement a week! Make sure you have time for this class!!
Good teacher, bad class. The field placements are ridiculous. They are twice a week, 6 hours per week in Wilmington. No tests, the entire class grade is based on participation except for the final project. The final project is graded VERY hard!!
This class seems kinda cool at first but I got this weird feeling that I was being pushed to think what Eugene wanted me to think. In the end it all felt kinda creepy. I consider myself liberal but in my experience Eugene isn't totally open to students disagreeing with his points :(
Matusov is a very enjoyable lecturer.  His dialogic approach to teaching means that you will be heard, responded to, and stretched.  You will find him inexpressibly cute by the end of the semester.
Class is basically juss descussion. Definitely have to attend class, but the workload through the semester is basically 10 minutes a week. No tests, but final project at the end of the semester is graded toughly, however you can submit multiple drafts to better your grade. Eugene truly cares about his students and is passionate about the subject.
Eugene was really passionate about teaching and really cares about his students. Tough grader when it comes to the final project but he is only pushing you to do your best. Very understanding and wants to help you and see you succeed.
Didn't really learn anything in this class and the webpostings and miniprojects become a pain. Only graded on completion of assignment, and only other grade is the huge project at the end of the semester which is a pain, but you are allowed to turn it in over and over until you get the grade you want!
Compassionate professor!  Genuinely cares about each one of his students.  I highly recommend taking this class with professor Matusov.","Great Professor and an easy A. this class is super easy. choose an open or opening syllabus.

587,"Satoshi is not a bad professor. Probably the best one to take this class with. Make sure to get a good TA for the discussion section. 6 HW's, 2 exams, 2 quizzes,extra credit. Material is difficult/confusing and the grading is a bit tough. Great class if you need Ling101, not good as a free elective. Good class, but only take if you are required to.
Satoshi is one of the sweetest professors in the department. He legitimately cares about his students, something I find to be sadly more and more rare. He rarely gives out 100% on anything, but it is also rare to completely fail. He gets so into his teachings that he can lose students, and other students take advantage of his kindness, sadly.
Best professor for senior seminar! Tomioka is very caring and understanding, and treats students like they know what they're doing and not like children. Seminar could be a bit dry because it was mostly student presentations, but definitely possible to get an A. No exams, some written assignments.
Great person, wonderful with study abroad, but was a difficult teacher and often didn't have control of the room.  Lots of cheating in the class.  Good teacher and good person...get to know him!
Everyone needs to study for this class. It is not hard but it is a challenging class. He is the best professor for this class and he lets you use charts for the tests so take him. Overall its easy to get a B
Love this man. Class is not hard at all if you keep up. Discussion sections are definitely more helpful than lectures. Not a hard class to get an A in. Definitely recommend this class. Your TA could make or break your experience so just hope you get a good one.
He's precious. Definitely recommend. Two exams (non-cumulative), 6 HWs, and 2 quizzes. A lot of extra credit too. Discussion sections are way more helpful than lecture. Skipped half the lectures and still managed a B. Take him!
This man is adorable. He is definitely the best prof for this class because he doesn't make you memorize the chart and he is hilarious. The material seems more difficult than it really is. The hardest part is figuring out what he is asking! The discussions were helpful and I recommend going to the tutors before a test to clarify the main points.
Easy A if you go to class and learn the material. Discussions are helpful with a good TA. There are only 2 exams (mid-term and final), 6 HW's that have a group section, 2 quizzes. Highly recommended. He's awesome!
Great professor. He keeps class fun and interesting, and is easy to understand. You don't have to memorize much since he gives you a chart of phonetic symbols for the exams. Definitely take him for linguistics!
Satoshi is cool and funny! He throws in funny examples & movie clips! One of the easiest LING professors at UD. He does have not accent so sometimes he words stuff a lil weird on exams & hws but your TA can clear it up for u. I had an awesome TA- Toni M. who really helped!
Satoshi is a pretty cool guy. The class isn't hard if you pay attention and make sure you go to office hours if you don't understand something. He's the only ling101 professor who doesn't require you to memorize each sound so definitely take it with him
He is a great Professor and the class is fairly interesting.  Easy A if you pay attention at lectures and do the homework. 2 non-cumulative tests.  A textbook that you don't need.  Memorize sounds and you'll do fine.
Satoshi is a great professor, and you wouldn't expect him to relate to students.. but he used regional differences saying ""high, stoned, baked"" etc. and the Simpsons as examples in class. You earn the grade you get in the class, it's not given to you. Take good notes!
He is not hard to understand, but you can forget about the ta's. They try to be helpful but most of the time it doesn't work because you can't understand anything that comes out tof their mouths. You'll do fine if you go to class and do well on the homeworks. All of that makes up 30% of your grade.
nice guy, class sucks- you have to buy textbook, the ta's are helpful but do not take it at 8am, you will regret it
He is a good teacher, funny and tries to explain everything. MEMORIZE the phonemes...and never forget. Go to lecture, for the ta's can't speak or explain anything very well. He can speak pretty decent english as well
He's a good guy and tries to bring some humor into lectures.  Disliked the class more than I disliked the professor.  Please, do yourself a favor and do not take this class for a group requirement.  I came out knowing nothing useful.
Memorize symbols!  Or wahtever the hell those thigns were called.  He speaks english, but very proper and with an accent.  Keep with slides, but lecture is very boring.  The TA's cant speak english at all.
Even though he is from Japan, he is very easy to understand.  He is humorous during class and is easy to talk to.  The class is not that bad if you take the time to memorize the basic symbols and info.","Satoshi is not a bad professor. Probably the best one to take this class with.

588,"Prather is very tough, and Field Theory is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. He gives mad homework and the exams are pretty tough. He will fry you up in class if youre falling asleep or on your phone, but its because he wants you to pay attention. Dont go to class if you dont care. I think he is great, and I learned a lot.
Prather patted my back. I finally felt like I had a father. Tough because he cares.
Prather is not a good professor as a lot of people say. He calme that he is eager to help but whenever you go to his office he would grill you, you will hear a lot of off topic comments. I went to his office to get help one then I decided that I will not come agin, he wasnt helpful. Also, if your English is bad expect a special treating.
Super nice, but note that TAs are worthless
Prather is an amazing teacher and exceptional lecturer. No other professor has held my interest in a subject more than he has. On the flip side, his tests are insanely hard and he does not like distractions in class. Show up to every lecture, do the homework, and study hard and you will do fine. If you are struggling he is eager to help you out.
Dr. Prather pushes you and this will probably be one of the harder classes you take. That being said, I learned a lot. If you're willing to work hard, you can do well.
One of the hardest classes you'll ever take. He is very upfront with what is expected of you. Overall he is a fair teacher and is willing to help in any way he can. Go to the study sessions and office hours for extra help.
Great professor ~!
Excellent in teaching Fourier optics. Working in his group requires prior knowledge in the subfield you are supposed to work on. Very helpful professor, often willing to help his students accomplish and reach their career goals.
The subject material is broad and involved, so the class is necessarily tough.  Things move a very quick clip and skipping class will almost guarantee that you do not do well.  Do the homework, go to class, and get help early.  The tests are straight forward but long, and not being solid with your concepts will kill you.  Great Prof all together.
Subject and exams very hard. Professor taught straight from another book but was very straightforward in telling students what it took to pass.  Fair grading on HW and exams.  ""You will work extremely hard for a C, need to be brilliant for a B, and MAYBE one student will get an A.""  Straight from DP's mouth.  Good sense of humor though ! Good luck!
Dr. Prather is a fantastic electromagnetics professor. All of his policies are made clear on day one. He will tell you that if you work hard, you can get an A, which couldn't be more true. He writes fast, but is great at explaining EM concepts and emphasizes the physics over the math. Very fair exams. Work hard, go to class, and you can do well.
NEVER skip class.  NEVER talk in class.  NEVER smile in class.  ALWAYS pay attention in class.  Do all your homework, even if it is Spring Break.  Then, maybe then, you will get your C- and get out of there.  Oh, yeah, you better be able to take notes, because there will be plenty of them.  If you are not required to take this class, then DON'T!!!!
grades harsh, talks fast, wont give you the time of day for help.  He is passionate about his subject, likes lecturing.  Exams are involved but straitforward, but I would always get bad grades anyway.  Subject is great, I love EM + signals.
Taught me a lot about electromagnetics.  Good guy, personable, good sense of humor.  Hard homeworks, impossible exams, sizeable curve.  Moves incredibly quickly, and covers a ton of material in each lecture.  Don't skip or fall asleep in his class.
Very difficult. Arrogant. Goes really fast. TAs are worthless.
You should watch how fast this guy writes! It's amazing. Smart.
i got a 76 and 85 on the first 2 tests, yet managed to get a C+ in the class
Great guy, always willing to help, wants you to understand, but moves fast.

Material learned in class is very theoretical and can be interesting, but it doesnt apply to any of the labs/projects we do (which count for 60% of our grade!)  Luckily there's 1 test and it's simple, and he gives as much time as you want for homework.
Compiler design.  I hated the topic, but he taught the class decently well.  Never made me interested in it though.  Difficult topics and was at 8:30am, which made it worse.  You can tell he really knows his stuff though.
what the hell are you saying Gao?  I could sit near the back of the room and his spit would still land near me when he talked.  Hongbo is the real professor for this class.",Dr. Gao is very knowledgeable. Communication skills need improving. A great person. Material learned in class is very theoretical and can be interesting. Difficult topics. You can tell he really knows his stuff though.
590,"Cope was amazing, really knew what he was talking about. Funny old man and made EN 102 a really fun class. He'd talk a little much but it wasn't really anything you couldn't handle. Just a good ole hippie with a love for English.
Favorite Prof to date. Brilliant, charismatic and earnestly wants his students to learn all that he has to offer. He grades fairly, and is a delight to listen to in class. I've personally taken just about every class he's taught while attending! Anyone who has the chance: Take one of his classes! He is one of the reasons GRCC is a great college. :)
Shakespeare was an amazing course!  Loved watching some of the plays to better under stand the reading.
Great teacher. I loved his lectures and anecdotes. Very easy grader and also very helpful.
Cope is awesome! Hated his class. He didn't really show interest and ended up making it a gender/culture studies class. Cope is one of the coolest guy I have met @ CC. He's super helpful and literally writes your paper with you. The stories he told were actually more enjoyable than the class itself. Awesome teacher, disliked the class.
Great Teacher! He will go above and beyond! He responds to emails THAT DAY! and will help you where help is needed. His knowledge astounds me!
He's a very nice guy and is always willing to help. But his class is complete torture. He talks. And talks. And talks. And talks. It was painful at times.
I was prepared to love this guy, somebody told me he was a close friend of Allen Ginsberg, and I'm a huge fan, but Cope was AWFUL. Played favorites like nobody's business. If you weren't one of his three or four ""golden kids,"" forget it, you might as well stay home. Disappointing on so many levels.
I had Cope for Shakespeare and it was one of my favorite classes. He started out with the intention of going over a certain number of plays, but if the class was spending more time on the plays than anticipated, he dropped some of the plays. Cope is always ready to help you and will edit your papers before you turn them in. Great professor.
GREAT PROF! Is always online to answer any questions via email. Helps edit papers. Not much work to do for the semester.
GREAT PROF! If you ever have any questions he's always online to help via email. Helps edit papers.
You are lucky if you have Prof. Cope for this class. Four papers the whole semester and he helps with editng a whole bunch!
He was just ok. He wasn't very clear on assignments. Also, all we did was read and write about the struggles of other cultures, in a 102 class you would expect there to be more variety. I hardly attended because most of the class was just him telling anecdotes from his childhood. Very nice guy though and he is willing to help you with anything.
extremely easy class. There are only 4 papers all semester and he will help you all he can and even let you turn papers in late. If you want a class that will help you with writing but wont cause the stress that other classes will then this is the professor to take.
He is a good professor and a cool guy, he is also very lenient and an easy grader.  However, he goes off on A LOT of random tangents that have nothing to do with anything. If you ask a question, he will probably tell a 10 min story not at all pertaining to your question
He is such a great teacher. There at 4 papers due the whole semester and he helps you every step of the way. He helps in any way possible to help you succeed.
You should be lucky if you get Prof. Cope. He is willing to go to great lengths to help you succeed. I transferred to GVSU and he gets that people aren't going to be at cc forever.. he will give you advice to help you succeed down the road. Listen to him.. I can't even begin tell you how much it will help!!!
Best Shakespeare Prof. ever!
Prof Cope is a really cool teacher.  He is very reachable and laid back.  He really knows his stuff and will make you a better writer.
Cope is a good professor. He has plenty of credentials. I don't have any complaints about the man. He's excited to be teaching Shakespeare and seems to never leave his email inbox's company. If you want to take Shakespeare, enroll in his class.","really knew what he was talking about. Brilliant, charismatic and earnestly wants his students to learn all that he has to offer. Great teacher. He will go above and beyond! He's a very nice guy and is always willing to help. it was one of my favorite classes. GREAT PROF! "
591,"Dr. Reid was my first professor after a 20 year hiatus from college.  I absolutely loved having him as a professor. He is very personable and wants his students to do well. He will not hand you the answers, you need to rightfully work for them. He is very fair. I thoroughly enjoyed the class.
He was honestly a great teacher. He makes you participate but you do learn a lot more that way. I had trouble with languages and I was still having trouble with this class but he was very helpful and will actually sit down with you and take the time to help you out. I highly recommend him if you really want to take Spanish.
Will assign homework and wont grade it for mistakes. Expects you to know what you did wrong and ""refer to the book"" if your confused. Wont give half credit on assignments. Relies on website to teach you everything. Weighted grades 88%. Doesn't actually teach at all, uses words and phrases not in the chapter vocabulary.
Sucks, has no mercy, jerk who doesn't help students! Makes you fee like an idiot in front of the whole class.
He is a great professor. He knows a lot about what he teaches and loves what he does. VERY helpful.
Fun teacher
I used to love Spanish till I got Richard Reid! He doesn't answer questions cause he nevers understands what you are asking, grades like a jerk, and doesn't cut you any breaks on anything!
was very helpful, made sure you understood everything...tests just like the study guides...even the final exam!  One of the best!!!
He knows what he's talking about, but the class is very boring. He likes his tests and he has no mercy. You'll learn to speak and write the language well if you pay close attention and do all the work he asks - and it's a lot of work!
if you dont check your email or blackboard, dont take this class; he helps before tests if you need it; no homework-tests every other week and the other weeks a writing assingment is due
I thought he is really great. I am taking his other SP102 class and am already looking forward to it. His classes are hard and if you just want the credit, do not take him. But language wise, he is awesome. So far, one of my favourite profs.
mr reid is a great professor, he made sure you understood everything before he moved on, he is a hard teacher, but really helpful and really catches your attention.  definatly one of my favorite professors
Sr. Reid is the best teacher I have ever had! He is extremely funny. His tests are hard, but if you are there to learn, you will do great. He is very helpful and understanding and he is just so awesome and a truly great man. I'm gonna miss him.
Sr. Reid is kinda easygoing but he puts tests too close together.  Don't take this class if you don't check your email or ""blackboard"" because that is how he lets you know the nite before it is due.
takes pride in degrading and humiliating students when they make mistakes; doesn't allow enough time in-between tests; waits until the night before a due date to post the assignment; never posts grades so students can track their progress.
He is always bringing humor to the classroom and that makes it more fun!
Loved this professor!  Great voice, easy to comprehend what he's saying, very helpful.  Best professor I've ever had!
Amazingly clear aside from grading procedures, but always striving to help & funny.
he's a awesome instructor, he crack you up!! very interesting, humorous person.
Very good teacher, very clear and good class enviornment","I absolutely loved having him as a professor. He was honestly a great teacher. Will assign homework and wont grade it for mistakes. He knows a lot about what he teaches and loves what he does.was very helpful, made sure you understood everything"
592,"This professor is absolutely terrible. The work is Mindtap assignments with quizzes and exams through blackboard. He does not lecture or teach at all, you are paying to read a book and take tests. Has a 14 page research paper for full term course but not during the shortened ones. Dropped me from his class without notice/warning, cost me money/time
The class is basically a research paper which has to be done to his liking. Sent us an email with 31 mistakes that would be an instant fail. Is OBSESSED with being addressed as Dr or Professor, I had an email chain 8 emails long, and I sent one email where I only asked if a source was ok to use, and he said he was taking points of my grade.
DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. He is extremely unfair and rude. I emailed him the first week and asked a question and because it was not formatted right he took 10 points off my weekly assignments. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOURE OK WITH BEING TALKED TO UNKINDLY AND POSSIBLE FAILING 
He was extremely difficult and unhelpful. He doesn't like when you don't refer to him as ""Dr."" in emails, but he misspelled my name in an email response. He failed me for the paper which seems to be more focused on following his format than the quality and content of the paper itself and is worth 40%. Don't take this class with this professor.
All your efforts on assignments and quizzes are useless when it comes to grading. His grading depends on just a final research paper and he is so strict on that. I do not understand the logic behind that. Totally unfair! I do not recommend him to any body, very discouraging! 

Take this course, but not with this Professor. 
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. He is awful. Your whole grade depends on a final paper that he grades very hard on. I had an A in the class until the paper and because I messed up one thing I got an awful grade. In you have the chance to take another professor do not take this guy. He is terrible. 
The worst professor I've ever had. Took SO254 as a dual enrollment class and it was awful. I submitted sources for a paper, and he deleted the ones he approved off of my document so I couldn't access them again. Lost points for not addressing him in a third reply email. 10 page paper due and is no help at all if you have questions. DO. NOT. TAKE.
I just started this class and I'm horrified!  The syllabus is in the most god awful font ever!  He requires a Mindtap account for his class, I emailed him because I was curious if I could use a cheaper option like an online amazon textbook and I lost points because I said ""hello!"" instead of Dr Williams. This type of professor is a form of torture.
One paper due at the end of the semester that he is sooooo particular on. If you want to do anything in his class, make sure you follow his EXACT instructions or forget it. He acts like he's some higherpower and you are not allowed to email him/turn the paper in without a step by step format he makes you follow - even when your emailing him. 
Final paper is worth 40% of your grade. Heavy homework. 3 chapters of roughly 4-5 assignments for each for one week, then quizzes on all 3, then an exam on all 3. Dont say hello in emails (points taken off), just Dr. Williams, body, your name. Would not do again, but it wasnt awful. He does have very clear instructors for the final paper though.
Most brutal professor I've ever had. Research is worth 40% of your grade. Quizzes and test are easy but the way he grades your research paper is absolutely brutal! For a junior college standards are very high. I would avoid him at all cost.
He flat-out tells you he will mark you down for calling him anything but Dr. Williams and is intimidating to email. He grades the paper components really tough and only gives grade by letter, so 70, 80, 90 only, no in between. The quizzes/tests are easy, but if it wasn't required to take his classes, I'd avoid his classes for the paper stress.
3 chapters for one week. Second week is 3 quizzes (you get extra credit if you complete it before Tuesday at 5 pm). Third week is an exam. Then repeat. He responds to emails (if you format them correctly) There is one paper. 40% of your grade. He gives you a detailed outline to follow. I finished his class with a 97% (not including the paper).
I had him for two classes at the same time (both SO classes) and instantly regretted it. It was the most homework I've had so far in any class. He is confusing sometimes and very ""do exactly this"". The final paper is worth like 40% of your grade, so if you fail that you fail the class. It's week 6 out of 15 and I never want to take him again.
No paper, lots of reading, lots of quizzes and exams. If you do your work early in the week, you get extra credit, which is helpful. Did not have to email, but his syllabus has specific instructions on how to do so without losing points. It seems intimidating, but shouldn't have to email anyway. Class is straightforward.
I took this class online and was worried based on prior reviews. There was not a paper in the class, just chapter quizzes and exams. Everything is done through Mindtap or Blackboard with 0 lecture/interaction. TONS of extra credit available! Take advantage of that and it's an easy A. Lots of reading, so schedule accordingly.
Your grade basically hinges on a final research paper that is worth 40%, he gives no teaching instruction except for an out dated syllabus with contradictory information through out. If you ask for help, he replies with a vague answer or with an irritated tone. This professor lacks passion for his students and seems only to be there for the ckeck.
The best way I can describe this prof is that he has multiple typos in his syllabus yet he takes points off of you if you email him incorrectly.
currently in his class. its too late to drop it. I want to die.",This professor is absolutely terrible. Is OBSESSED with being addressed as Dr or Professor. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. He was extremely difficult and unhelpful. Most brutal professor I've ever had. He grades the paper components really tough. 
593,"Missad is by far the best professor I've ever had. Show up to class, participate, listen to instructions, hand in homework in time, and you have an A for this class in the bag. She is very quick at responding to emails, and appreciates a student who is not afraid to ask questions. Warmly recommend this professor. She's very intelligent & caring!
She is such a great person and she has so much great advice! The class itself is not all that great but it is super useful to new college students. She makes it her goal for everyone to be able to learn. I highly recommend her if you can get her!
Prof. Missad was amazing! There is a lot of discussion in her class, but it's really interesting. She sets up a lot of different activities for the class, and they somehow all are related to the topics we discuss in class. It's an overall fun class, and it really makes you think. She's great and she's hilarious!
Pat Missad is a great professor. I learned a lot this semester and the class was super easy.
very good instructor. do your work and you will do great in her class.
Pat is a very interesting teacher and she keeps it fun. Little side comments are hilarious and personal stories are as well! ""Be safe be smart if you're not smart please don't drive, commit a senseless act of kindness see you on monday""
She is extremely funny and helpful. She is one of the best teachers I have ever had. Shes awesome. She makes each class fun and exciting.
Pat is a wonderful teacher! She makes the class extremely interesting and doesn't sugar coat anything. It's all right out there for you to hear.
like all CD classes theres alot of busy work so you have to keep up on it. tests are open book. pat makes lectures very informal, interesting, and she knows her stuff. i'd recommend her class to anyone!
I love this woman!  She is a great teacher, and really makes class as interesting as she can. Tests are open book and open note, and if you show up for every class, there's no way you can't pass.  I would follow her anywhere
she was an awesome prof. one of the first things she said in class was 'im not going to stand up here and babble to you' but i really wish she had because i could listen to her talk forever. she knows her stuff and wants you to pass.  i would take another class by her even if it was over quantum physics.
She was a pretty good prof. She knew her stuff - however, I really didn't learn a whole lot throughout the class. Sometimes she rambles on and on but she can be really funny at times. Tests are easy - open book, open note. Pretty simple, tolerable class.
Pat rocks! She's a really great teacher, very helpful, let's you know exactly what she expects from you. Tests are open book, but you should still study or you'll spend the whole test period looking for an answer. Class interaction is fun, she's very open minded. Take this class!
Love this class, she is amazing and knows her stuff.  Very easy class...open book and open note tests..its amazing
she is a great teacher!!! i loved her class!
An easy A
Pat Missad rocks, as did this class, Relationships and Human Sexuality. I was interested in the class, but never realized how much I would learn throughout it. I wish I could take it again, with my fiance. TAKE THIS CLASS, you WON'T regret it!! Tip: tests are open-book, but take notes/pg. numbers so you can finish the test more quickly.
She is brilliant. Seriously, a 7:45 class that I only missed once? It's a great class. She lectures with enthusiasm. I just loved it. Very easy. Open book tests. You can turn your papers in early...get them back and fix them.. She is just awesome. Truely cares about the well-being of her students.
Great teacher, doesn't do a lot of teaching. She lectures very little, lots of group work and some videos, but all pertain to the topic covered in class. All Exams are open book but she is very picky with the answers, drops lowest one. Allows papers to be turned in early for better grade show up to class, put time into your work, you will do great!
very nice teacher very easy class","She is such a great person and she has so much great advice! very good instructor. do your work and you will do great in her class. She is extremely funny and helpful. She is one of the best teachers I have ever had. She is a great teacher, and really makes class as interesting as she can. "
594,"Scott knows journalism and does whatever he can to help his students! He is willing to sit down with students and help them improve their writing. If you come to class, do the work and try to improve, you will do great in the class. Overall, a great teacher and extremely knowledgeable and willing to go above and beyond for his students!
Scott is an amazing instructor. He is clearly committed to the ideals of Journalism and integrity. He develops his students to think critically by forcing us to think through struggles, and encouraging us to continuously ask ""why?"".  This class is not about ""pouring your heart out"", it's about concise and accurate writing and reporting w/integrity.
This guy is full of himself.  He must hate his job, and the students that he is supposed to teach.  He will tear you down if you pour your heart and soul into your writing.  He just doesn't care if the student succeeds or not.  He offers no support or suggestions for his online class.
Scott is just TERRIBLE. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Communication sucked and there was no point in coming to class. There are tons of more productive ways to waste your time. The students editors were awful and played favorites, just like Scott. It has been by far the WORST JOURNALISM CLASS THAT I HAVE TAKEN SO FAR.
Scott is just TERRIBLE. This journalism class is AWFUL. He plays favorites, lets the student editors run the class, and they suck by putting their own articles in the Collegiate first. The communication was HORRIBLE. AVOID THIS CLASS. DO NOT TAKE IT. There are plenty of more productive ways to waste your time.
Communication, TERRIBLE. I know he has a lot of students to deal with but come on! POOR GRADING. He's really TOUGH. Doesn't strive his students to success. It's like he hates his job, and it's ""just a job"". I don't agree with no re-do's to improve your grade. He just slams you with rude comments even if you put your heart and soal into a paper. :-(
Very clear syllabus. Tells exactly what you need to do. Helpful if asked. Answers emails quickly and professional.
Grades tough, poor communication for the telecourse.
Grades difficult, poor communication
AVOID AVOID AVOID! He is very unclear on what he wants in his class. He never mentions participation, then slaps you with a bad grade at the end because you didn't speak up enough. He doesn't really give you the chance to talk either, he just sits in front of class and rambles about nonsense. I am an A student and got a C. AVOID if at all possible.
Worst professor I ever had
Speaking up and participating are the key's to passing his class. Be prepared to defend your argument! But expect to clash on opinions. He allows rewrites and is an easy grader, so the papers are no problem. He's a pretty decent guy.
Very helpful. Loaned me the textbook when I couldn't afford it at the beginning of the semester.
Always allows rewrites for higher grades. Not easy if you don't do the work. Helped me with a problem.
I don't think he understands averages or I don't because we don't agree on my grade at all and that is based on his marks.  I was on the Deans List until I took his class; can't get anything better than a ""c"" out of him.  Do not take his class!!
Worst professor I have ever had!!! I got no lower than a 90% grade all semester (got a 94% on the final exam/paper) and got slammed with a C+ in the class simply because I didn't ""participate"" in class enough. Plays favorites, and allows NOBODY to disagree with his viewpoints.
Telecourse: very unhelpful, didn't answer emails, seemed to want unrealistic results.  I would not recommend nor take another one of his courses.
AVOID!!! Worst teacher I have EVER had. He never helps you at all with your work. He grades you on participation, but only calls on his ""favorites"" When I questioned him about my grade he freaked out on me and called me a liar. He can't handle anyone that might not agree with him. 0/10 AWEFUL!
He doesn't help you very often. Very unorganized, Doesn't make  himself clear on things he wants done he expects him to read your mind... AVOID at all costs.
Great class to take in telecourse format with him.  He has a detailed syllabus and has you write alot but you do not have to agonize with peer reviews with classmates.  Very fair, good teacher.  Good feedback with return of papers via mail.  I would recommend this class to those who can keep on task with deadlines and don't like classroom!","Scott is just TERRIBLE.

595,"This professor is very passionate about the subject and his lectures are very interesting and informative.  I would recommend taking his course.
Best prof I ever had. I loved American History, but thought World History would be boring. Was I ever wrong. He taught history through literature and required us to read Oedipus Rex.  As a result, I fell in love w/ Greek lit as well.
Wow, is this guy still teaching? I had him back in 1974, and he turned me into a history junkie. I have earned two undergraduate degrees, and his history class was the single most memorable class I ever took. He presented the point of view of every person or group or religion or ?? from that person's viewpoint - very convincingly. My best prof...
Schlosser is the best professor at cc, the most knowledgable man on campus. He may come off as intimidating but he is extremely helpful and is very clear on what is to be expected out of you in his class. Make sure to attend EVERY lecture and to take notes, good notes. My favorite professor at GRCC.
Seriously my FAV. by far! great professor! makes class interesting! great sense of humor!
Schlosser is the best proff I have ever had hands down! I came in to his class expecting it to be alright at best, and it blew me out of the water. He is extremely helpful, giving handouts that clearly outline test material; these with notes is a guaranteed A+. Only time I opened my book was at the end of the semester for our last test.
Absolutely amazing prof! He tells you exactly what is going to be on the test and reviews it at the beginning of each class. Just pay attention and take notes on the things he stresses and you will do fine. You can bomb the MC test questions but still get an A from the essays which are always on the class lectures.
By far the most knowledgeable professor at grcc.  His class is not easy, but if you attend lecture and take notes it's no problem.  Wouldn't recommend it for those of you just looking for an easy A with no work involved, but if you're in college to learn TAKE  HIS  CLASSES.  This man could teach history at any university he wanted to.
Did not like him one bit! If you love to take notes and get off topic all the time, he would be great for you. He would talk about history for 20 mins then tell stupid stories that have nothing to do with the class.If your not a good test taker, you will hate this class only 5 test and no assignments which means your grade is based on your tests
I LOVED this class.  He was crazy funny, test were hard, be prepared for lots of note taking and studying.
HORRIBLE. he uses about 10 minutes of class time to teach and the rest is stories about his life which have no relation to what we are learning in class. he swears all the time. even when there's no point to, just to come off as a hard ass. he teaches government but is one minded and refuses to accept other people's points of view.
This has been one of my favorite professors I have had.  He is very open and blunt.  Very funny keeps things interesting, but also relates to things that are going on in class.  The only thing is he forgets where he is from class to class, so sometimes repetitive.
This guy is hilarious,often has class fighting back tears of laughter.Knows what hes talking about & tells it like it is.uses profanity.tells many stories that r all very interesting& relate 2 topic.never remembers how far he got w/ each class so sometimes you'll hear the exact same story more than once which is a annoying.never uses book in class
Not a fan. I think he really failed to make the subject interesting by overloading us with personal and irrelevant stories. He's rigid in his teaching style and discourages  class discussion and participation. Even though the lectures seem simple, the tests are extremely difficult. Do yourself a favor and find a different history prof..
he was AMAZING...can't say enough good things about this man. my mom had him and so did i...take him, you will learn tons.  made me pick history as my major, but no teacher could compare after him.  LOVE HIM!
He doesn't teach as much as tell historical bed time stories. He is completely unable to stay focused while lecturing as his attention span is less than that of an infant. He doesn't use the textbook at all. My class has not opened the textbook even once throughout the course of this class.
Schlosser is awesome!  I hated having to take American Government, but having him as an instructor made up for it.  As long as you can handle brutal honesty and some profanities, he is the best teacher at GRCC.  I prefer a teacher who is real and who is not afraid to say what he thinks, and that is Schlosser.  Take him any chance you get!!
Took his Irish History class, easily one of the most influential and well-taught classes I've ever taken. He's usually pretty difficult as a teacher, but the content is rich, he's VERY informative, and he is an AMAZING human being. If you're up for a challenge, he comes with my top recommendation!
He is one of my favorite professors ever.
What an amazing prof.  It's been 5 years since I took his class and I still think about the guy.  I became a history teacher because of him, and I never regret a day.  Real genius and puts history into a modern perspective.  Got some great stories too.  I'll never forget when he cracks a diet pop in his classroom..""Ahhh, sounds of the weekend""",This professor is very passionate about the subject and his lectures are very interesting and informative. great professor! He is extremely helpful. By far the most knowledgeable professor at grcc. Knows what hes talking about.  he's VERY informative.
596,"Takes serious topics and makes them more fun and approachable. Sparks good discussions and keeps students interested even in a 3 hour long lecture.
AMAZING 
Not the best at teaching logic and just reads from the book with a heavy accent that leads to a lot of confusion. Does not use a white board to clarify how arguments are constructed to create the different patterns, i.e. Vertical, Horizontal, Conjoint, and Multiple Conclusion. Awful, lacking teaching skill or knowledge of materials being taught.  
Fully online course.  Every week he had us do a two page paper (double spaced) about the reading and it was basically on your view/opinion on the reading. He does provide lectures every week but I found it kind of hard to understand the lecture. All in all he is a very sweet & discussed interesting topics in his class that I enjoyed writing about.
Professor Chen is very straight forward about his assignments. There is a lot of reading but I found the readings interesting and the papers were engaging because a lot of them asked for your perspective on ideas so they were pretty easy to write. 
AWESOME professor!! His online course for Introduction to Philosophy looks the same each week which is really nice: read a chapter and write a 2-page essay. A SUPER easy grader; there's no way you wouldn't get a 100% on the weekly papers unless you didn't turn it in or completely butchered the topic. My favorite professor so far!
Jianchu Chen had a strong accent but I didnt find it as bad as other students did. His recorded lectures were very informative but a bit redundant to the reading material. I found that you only needed to pick one or the other to succeed. He gave full points but offered odd feedback like: ""Too Sketchy"" Which wasn't very helpful.
His class required a lot of papers, but as long as you were willing to put in the work he was willing to work with you. I'm a biology student but he got me genuinely interested in philosophy. Fantastic grader and super laid back. Amazing professor. Just be prepared to read a lot, write a lot, and sit in a long lecture.
you don't have to be going into a medical field to get a good grade in/enjoy this class. though English isn't his first language, Chen makes a true effort to easily convey the material. you can pass without watching the lectures or reading the full chapter, just make sure you skim it enough when you write papers and have the book nearby for exams.
Class consists of weekly papers and reading. Overall great professor.
His accent is a little hard to understand, but I didn't even really need his lectures to pass the class. Just do the reading and you'll be fine. He has weekly papers over two topics and they are very easy to answer. He gives out study guides that follow the test format exactly, so tests are easy as well. Highly recommend this prof
I really enjoyed this class. Professor Chen provided great lectures and made sure that everything we read from the books aligned with what we were learning about (There are 2 books you have to rent/purchase). He is a very kind and understanding person. Definitely take this class if you can! Easy A
He was a good professor but has a heavy accent. The videos he posts are pretty long but easy enough to follow along with and he does give plenty of details in the videos.
I took Intro to Logic with Professor Chen online. If I am not mistaken, Intro to Logic wasn't offered online for fall 2020 until COVID so he made helpful videos where he reads through the assigned textbook portion and clarifies important parts. His quizzes seem to be graded for completion but he is always there to answer questions too! I recommend.
Professor Chen was always responsive to questions, even outside of class times. The one issue I had is that he ran his classes Wed.-Tues. whereas all my other classes were Mon.-Sun. which just made it more inconvenient
Professor Chen constantly stutters when talking in his lectures to the point that I cannot understand a word that he says. I actually stopped listening to his lectures and just did the reading and the assignments and still ended up with an A in the class.
Professor Chen assigns one, two-paged paper a week. They are only for completion but still, try your best because he does read them. He gives out a study guide for the exam that have the exact questions as the exam, so it is easy to get an A. Just read the book, take notes, and you will pass the class.
I highly recommend Professor Chen. I took this class online during the summer. It is 6 one to two page papers on a prompt he gives each week, a midterm, and a final. For the midterm/final he gives a review guide and you can use that on the exam. He posts a video each week which goes over the reading. He offers office hours if you need help.
Eight small essays. Pretty good lectures and study guides that prepares for the two exams.
Very kind and fun-loving. His homework grading criteria was a bit confusing for most of us, and we had to type 8 total essays (one every week). I didn't read much but still pass with decent grade. You can also use one page note in the midterm and final exam, so he made it easier for us with the given topics, questions, and vocab terms.","very straight forward about his assignments. A SUPER easy grader. had a strong accent. very informative. Amazing professor. Just be prepared to read a lot, write a lot, and sit in a long lecture. He was a good professor but has a heavy accent. Just read the book, take notes"
597,"Professor Paasche is fun and hard nosed.  If you like reading and discussing what you read, this class is for you.  I got through with an older text; there were only two stories that weren't in it.  One could probably get through the class using the library only.
Class was alright, but she can take some getting used to. Isn't always ready to go the extra mile to help, but she tries.
The group discussions are really interesting and every involved.  A few of the stories are really boring.  However, if you happen to have a question when she wants to move on (you will know when she wants to) she will completely ignore you.  As well as ignoring some questions that she doesn't want to answer. Alitte rude sometimes. Easy A though.
Paasche is a good professor. I've never been given an unfair grade in her class. Do the journals, the readings, and the projects, it's easy. If you don't do them then you shouldn't be in college. Enroll with her if you are interested in Fiction for college credit.
There is a lot of busy work in this class, but if you stay on top of everyday tasks...VERY easy A!
She loves literature, and makes the class pretty simple. Be willing to participate, because you grade depends on it. She loves uniqueness, so the sky's the limit! She loves to hear student's opinions. She gives many opportunities to bank points by speaking to the class about a story (To me, it was more of a leadership class than an english class).
she is the most boring teacher i ever met and its so hard to stay awake bcuz her voice is so low.She is a overall nice person through and very helpful but just boring
Can we say easy ""A""
Give the class your input, make her know you're there, you'll do fine. Be careful to keep up on your journals; they'll bite you in the end if you don't. She's very fair as well; exceptions are not made for anyone.
I am an English major who never got less than an A in any English class until I took hers, I have gotten Eng awards at GVSU, she made things really hard for me, even others in the class commented on this. I worked hard, but she did not like my work.
Super nice. So many opportunities to ""bank points"", relatively easy grader too. She really does enjoy hearing what everyone has to say. The ones who don't participate are only hurting themselves. I like the class a lot.
she is a great professor. she is very helpful and gives u alot of chances to get a A. I like the way that there is really no wrong answer in her english fiction class. all around great proff.
One of the best teachers at GRCC.  She makes time for her students, shares intresting books, helps students LEARN.
Very cool teacher! Class is pretty straight forward, do your journals and participate and you have an Easy A. She is a very nice teacher and loves to hear everyones opinions(in other words..you better participate)
She was excellent, always had time for students who tried, and participated in class.
A lot of reading.  Pay attention for symbolism and participate in class activities and you'll do fine.  She isn't the greatest communicator though, sometimes you think she's gonna fall asleep on you or something.
I liked this lady!  When you read, look for the symbolism! She likes that.
Very knowledgeable.  Just read, & participate.  You'll do fine.
She is a VERY sweet person, blelieves in all that tries! NICE COURCE!
awesome teacher.","If you like reading and discussing what you read, this class is for you. Paasche is a good professor. Easy A. relatively easy grader. Class is pretty straight forward. A lot of reading. participate in class activities. Very knowledgeable."
598,"Here is the thing, it's a tough class. You get an essay, quiz, and test with a chapter to read in a $90 textbook every week. However, that's it. There wasn't an exam and it's the same every week. Ended up getting an A by actually reading the textbook + taking notes. I'm actually going to take PS 201 as well since I already know how the class works.
This class was the hardest class that I have taken. We had homework that was due before the exams, it was short but super hard. We had to take 4 exams throughout his class, they were all really hard, even if you studied the textbook it was hard. He also talked really quietly so you couldn't really understand what he was saying half the time. 
Textbook is around $90 and mandatory. He does not provide any lecture videos. Get ready to teach yourself. Overall I thought the amount of work was not necessary and it did not help me learn. If you have no background knowledge on international politics or politics in general do not take this prof.
Okay a couple of things to lay out here: You will notice many different mixed reviews here, ranging from horrible to the best professor ever. Usually the people who didn't do well in the class, rated poorly. You will only fail in his classes if you don't read the criteria, and don't follow his rubric. It is an easy class if you put effort in.
Tough grader but not terrible. I took his class during the summer. If I did take his class again I would definitely focus more on being very specific in my writing. 
Took online. Very clear instructions for all assignments, but you will never hear from the professor. No class activities so you will feel completely alone. He's a tougher grader for papers (of which there are a lot) but lays out the rubric. Textbook was not a fun read. So many quizzes and tests!
I was nervous about this class. Excuse I have sever anxiety around tests. But the laid back and structured grading criteria were so helpful. I knew going into the week what was expected that week and every week. I was never overwhelmed. I would take a class with this professor again in a heartbeat.
BY FAR THE WORST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. 
Pretty decent professor. Im taking him again for another class and I feel good about that choice. Theres 4 assignments each week: quiz (cengage), assignment on cengage, short essay, test. Gives good feedback on the essay. Pretty average workload and class, I enjoyed it and Im not a huge fan of the subject even.
really great guy! he is very understanding and will do everything he can to ensure you pass. def knows his stuff but you will have to study to receive an A.. and this is coming from a polisci major..
He's tough on his stuff but is super clear on what to do to achieve an A in his class. If you take his online class read all the instructions he has tucked away into different areas. It really helps.
For his online classes, Bai does not post any sort of lectures or provide much support. The assignments are relatively easy, but the professor is not accessible. His assignments are either on Cengage (which requires an access code) or there's a short essay and test on Blackboard. He gives feedback for the essay, however it's not in a timely fashion
Great Professor! His syllabus makes the class sound like a cold, uncaring environment but he is a fair and just teacher who cares about his students. Lots of reading but the tests, essays and quizzes are all reasonable.
Every week we did the same thing. A few assignments on mindtap, a short paper, and a test. There are plenty of points to help boost your grade. The tests are open book. Overall, good class if you do the work.
Im not sure if its because the class is online, but it is quite a bit of reading and homework. However, it is all interesting material and very relevant to whats going on in the world right now. Prof. Bai gives great feedback on essays and is easy to reach with questions. Its a lot of work but I have enjoyed his class!
I have not even finished Yan's class and here I am. I would never take this professor again. He had us buy a textbook that had a political science class included with it. I am taking the class through the textbook. NEVER connect anything to current events unless you want a zero. Zero out of ten professor.
My second class with Professor Bai. He's very organized in the online platform which is great. This 200-level class was definitely more difficult than the 100-level I took with him, which is appropriate in my opinion. Best advice? Do the reading and you'll do well on the weekly tests.
Professor Bai is bar far the most organized online professor I've taken a class with. As a full-time online student - this is SO helpful. His expectations are clear and comprehensive. Liked him so much, also too another class with him. Highly recommend.
I took this prof for PS 110 in the summer semester. I was so nervous because of the online format. I had trouble with my Cengage code and emailed him. He emailed me before class started to make sure that I was good! Class consisted of watching a video, answering questions, taking a test and writing a 300 word essay. Great prof and cares about you!
I was nervous to take a class with professor Bai given the mixed reviews but I was pleasantly surprised and would absolutely take again. I took the online class, the grading criteria was straightforward and consistent. If you did your work your grade will reflect that. No complaints.","it's a tough class. This class was the hardest class that I have taken. Tough grader but not terrible. He's a tougher grader for papers. super clear on what to do to achieve an A in his class. Lots of reading but the tests, essays and quizzes are all reasonable. the grading criteria was straightforward and consistent."
600,"Tests are way too hard for a course that should be straight forward. Ive taken exams in the past that were worth 300 points, but thats the entire class grade. 3 exams, 100 points each, thats it. Mainly based on Essay Questions and 25 multiple choice. Avoid if you can. If you have to take this class just make sure you dont take it lightly.
Professor Kobak is very passionate about developmental psychology and it is evident in his lectures. His lectures are insanely boring. They seriously seem eternal, but he does not put his full slides online so it is good to go. Also he has clicker questions he uses for extra credit. If you don't read you will not get an A.
The classes were boring, the exams were impossible, and I struggled for my C.
This class shouldn't be as hard as it is made. Exams are confusing and a few questions were incomprehensible on each one. To make it worse, no specifics are given as to what will be on the exam, just how many questions from each chapter will be on it.  If you have the time to do every single reading you can do well, but you won't be able to cruise.
Dull, confusing, and vague. You will never know where the exam material is coming from. AVOID this professor...has no idea how a good psych class is taught. Easy B nothing more
AWFUL, BORING, puts you to sleep, tests are confusing
nice professor but the class gets really boring. uses powerpoints in class and there are 3 tests which constitute your whole grade. tests are pretty tricky, you need to study at least a couple nights in advance for them and even then you might still just get a B
Grade based off of 3 Multiple Choice tests (50 questions on each). No rounding or extra credit but its an interesting class. Dr. Kobak is a cool dude. If you're a psyc or human services major the tests will be obvious. Regardless, it's a totally fair class. Take it!
Kobak is a really nice guy! Classes seem pointless but his test questions come directly form the powerpoint! Don't need the textbook at all but you have to study for the tests. Go to class and study the material and you will definitely get at least a B.
This professor is adorable, and really funny. There was a lot of reading for each class, and he uses slides and would put them online before class. He shows a lot of good movie clips. Only 3 tests all semester and they were all multiple choice. There was a lot of material to cover, but it was an interesting class.
Very nice guy. Very helpful during office hours. It wasn't totally necessary to read the book, but I would at least read the summaries. Some MC questions are directly from readings. The most difficult part of the tests were the essays, and he was usually quite explicit about his expectations for them when reviewing the material prior to the test.
Nice guy, fine teacher. Got bored and distracted every once in a while, but I still got an A. If you are good at Psych, you will do fine.
This class overall was a good experience. However your grade is based on 3 tests (all multiple choice). Even though he does posts power points he DOES NOT include all the slides given in class.  So it's smart to attend class.  Plus he gives questions that appear on the test and he doesn't post those either.  Overall, a good professor.
I thought that this was a good class. Helps if you have some interest in child development. No extra assignments or papers, just three exams. Fantastic if you don't want to have to do much work throughout the semester, bad if you don't take tests well. Essays count for a lot on the test so if you can write clearly, you'll probably do well.
Enjoyable class! Posts powerpoints, Attending class helps on exams.
great guy. he means well. slides are great and he posts them online after classes. if you do go to classes he'll give you sample mutliple choice questions that actually appear on the exams. sometimes questions on exams are hard to understand though. definitely do the extra credit!
Slides are all over the place. to study you need to read which is a pain because his notes jump from chapter 1 to 14 without even clarifying. doesnt help at all when asked. dont recommend taking him
Extremely long powerpoints but will e-mail slides to class after presentation. Nice man, however seems somewhat aloof as most of his slides are disorganized and directly from the text. Class is important for learning exam material, but can do well just by reading the book. Do the extra credit and read the material- it would be hard not to pass.
Kobak is a very friendly, light-hearted guy who knows his stuff. Plenty of short films to make class enjoyable. 3 tests plus 10 possible pt. extra credit. Do the extra credit, you're almost guarenteed perfect credit. A ""B"" is definitely attainable if you put in some effort. I recommend him.",Tests are way too hard. The classes were boring. Exams are confusing and a few questions were incomprehensible on each one. the class gets really boring. Very nice guy. This class overall was a good experience. Enjoyable class! Do the extra credit and read the material.
601,"Prof Duke may seem very harsh at first. After receiving my first grade I was convinced I was going to hate her for the rest of the semester. She only tries to help, and she's actually wonderful. I'm not an English major, and there's  a reason for that, but as long as you show progress and don't slack off you will more than likely get a good grade.
Prof. Duke is very specific about what she wants from you. She may come off as harsh at first but you can do as many re-writes as you want before the due date and she's always available to look over them. Definitely improved my writing skills, and if you're willing to work and improve than it shouldn't be too hard  to get an A.
Avoid
Duke was pretty scary the first day but she is not so bad. It is important to do the readings, usually the lengthier reports get higher grades. Annoying when she moves her hair, overall nice teacher. Mostly everyone gets a B.
This was a required class for freshman and she didn't make it enjoyable.  She just tells you why your writing sucks and diminishes all previous skills you learned in high school.  Rude, harsh grader and annoying accent.  Grading policy is based on ""progress"" and reading assignments every class.  Avoid.
So funny! scary at first because shes a little intimidating but you learn to love her. Only four essays due the whole semester and if you meet with her one on one you'll get an A. Class isnt mandatory but its important to show face
awesome teacher! her grading is blunt and sometimes harsh but she genuinely wants you to improve. her class is fun as she is hilarious and has a very realist view of english (aka research papers are stupid and useless) highly recommended!
Just says that your writing is terrible- doesn't offer suggestions. A little too harsh. She treats students poorly, has a very terrible demeanor.
Dr. Duke will tell you exactly what is wrong with your writing. She may come off as blunt or crass when she is being honest about your work. Listen to her advice and try not to take her comments personally and you will see dramatic improvement in your writing.
I just didn't agree with this professor the entire time. While I enjoyed the lectures, I despised her assignments and I thought her grading policy was rubbish.
Basically she tells you all the things that you secretly suspected about writing in the first place, like 5 paragraph essays are stupid. Great teacher, if you listen to her you will improve at least one thing in your writing. Interesting lady, had some interesting class discussions.
Tedious work.  Have to do 6 journals every other week and four big papers.  She has a great personality.  She's blunt, but hey at least shes honest.  Not a bad class overall!
I absolutely love this woman. She is tough on your writing, but in a good way. Everyone emerges as a much better writer. She also ""rewards improvement"", so you can end up with an ""A"" without ever actually getting an ""A"" on an essay. She is a really cool person, and I would recommend her.
great teacher, fun class. had tons of laughs during classes, very funny teacher. her grading was hard but you definitely learn a lot. she only cares that you improve throughout the end of the semester. I ended up with a B+ which i never got higher than on a paper, but I got it because my work improved. I recommend her.
No research paper, six one page broad journals due every other week. Easy class, better choice than most other 110 professors because of no research paper. Got an A- with pretty minimal effort.
Shes kinda crazy but in a good way. doesnt believe in research papers so a very good choice for e110. assigns essays with broad topics that students get to personalize, also assigns journals which are not so bad but can be a lot of work if you put them off. i recommend her for anyone who needs to take e110 and who doesnt like research papers
She's really cool and kinda crazy.  She doesn't assign a research paper which is awesome.  She assigns 6 journal entries every two weeks and they are annoying but not hard.  She is a tough grader but she is really interested in trying to get her students to improve their writing skills.  We have great discussions in class that aren't boring.
One of the best professors I've had.  I had a great time in class without feeling like I was wasting my time.  She is great and loves to talk with students.  There's a fair amount of homework but you hardly mind when you simply love going to class every day.
Went to Australia and New Zealand with her.  I still talk to her every so often.  She's a great professor with a lot of love for students.  Definetly take her!
I only had her for one class-Intro to the Novel- while I was doing study abroad, but I loved her. We had a couple of classes in a pub! I can't accurately rate her grading because it was study abroad, but definitely a very fun lady. Very easy to talk to.",Avoid. A little too harsh. She is tough on your writing. she may come off as blunt or crass when she is being honest about your work. she only cares that you improve throughout the end of the semester. She doesn't assign a research paper. 
602,"He lectures for an hour with no PowerPoint, only 3 words on the chalkboard. He does not talk about the textbook but it makes up most of the exam questions so you're teaching yourself. Exams are hard. He also has a weird grading system. I would not take him again. 
This was by far the hardest class I've taken. Denemark is a nice guy and very smart, but he lectures for an hour with no powerpoint. Doesn't address textbook, but 1/2 the tests are on it so you have to teach 13 chapters to yourself. Exams are hard. His grading system is also super weird and confusing, no grades in Canvas. I wouldn't take him again.
Denemark is an excellent professor and great lecturer. Examples and content was always presented in an engaging way. You have to go to class to take notes, but he makes it worthwhile. He wants to make you work for it, but he really cares about providing a strong learning experience so it's definitely worth taking.
Denemark is an amazing professor and lecturer. He does a great job providing examples and keeping lectures engaging. Do have to attend every class to take notes, but he makes it worthwhile. Would definitely recommend + take again.
While Denemark is very knowledgable about everything that he teaches, his teaching methods are not ideal. He uses no powerpoints or anything. He only writes 3 questions on the board and then talks at you for the duration of the class. The discussion section wasn't too bad, usually a reading or two and then class discussion. Tests are difficult.
Good professor. Do the textbook readings as a lot of the exam questions are about the readings. For the class you will have a short one page paper to write and a total of three exams. The exam questions arent easy so go over your notes thoroughly. Not an easy A class but you will learn a lot so you should take it.
Possibly the best professors at the UD. Extremely intelligent, caring, and hilarious. I took this as a breadth and I was wary at first, but I feel much more knowledgeable about the world because of this class. Ngl its a hard class and you are gonna have to work for it. Grading is a little scary because he grades based on how your peers do.
Professor Denemark is one of the greatest professors at UD. He genuinely cares about his students and will work with students one-on-one. You definitely have to work hard in his classes, but it totally pays off.
Really smart guy, cares a lot about what he teaches which makes for very interesting and knowledgable lectures . Study, read, go to office hours if you must. Very entertaining - one of the best at UD.
Reason he is ranked this high: He is that good. Makes you want to get to class and actually learn. Smartest guy you'll ever listen to. 
Everyone praises Denemark, so I wanted to see what he was really about. I almost dropped this class - thank god I didn't. You have to work really hard and be confident but it is so worth it. Get to know his system of how he grades and you'll be fine. Participate as much as possible & pick a good seat where you will be noticed. Go to office hours. 
Denemark is such a cool guy! He is so nice and really willing to help you. His exams are tough though, most student average about a 50%, but then he grades the class based on standard  deviation and everyone's averages. If you ask him to help you, he will. Review sessions with him are SO helpful. Also, know current events for the exams. 
He is really awesome and the class is not as hard as you would think.  If you show up and listen you will soak up most of what you need to know.  Anyone interested in political science or IR needs to take him. He was the best professor I ever had.
This man is definitely one of the best Profs at UD. You definitely need to go to class and take notes. Exams are half lecture, half readings and he doesn't always go over readings. Otherwise, he is absolutely hilarious and extremely knowledgeable. you will learn SO MUCH!
By far, the best professor I've had at UD. He may seem intimidating, but he is very helpful, and very kind. You will learn more about life in his diplomacy class than you ever expected. You'll want to attend class, and you'll want to do the work.
Denemark is incredible. I learned more in his class than in any other class at UD. Take Diplomacy. It will change your life.
Tough tests, but very interesting lectures. He may seem intimidating, but he's actually really nice if you visit him in office hours. He wants everyone to do well. Made lecture material easy to understand by using everyday examples.
I love Dr. D
Awesome! He has none of the negative stereotypes associated with professors. Extremely intelligent & probably the most down-to-earth professor i've had. One of my all-time favorite teachers...
Absolutely best teacher at UD. Incredibly intellegent and helps with any question you have. Brings all lectures to life with great examples. Does not cover book material in lectures so it is important to read it in order to do well. Three tests, which are graded relative to everyone in your class, and two case studies. Take this class with Dr. D",Exams are hard. He also has a weird grading system. This was by far the hardest class I've taken. he lectures for an hour with no powerpoint. Not an easy A class. You definitely have to work hard in his classes. His exams are tough though. 
603,"Horrible experience. Took this class while I was a junior 5+ years ago and still to this day I can remember how unfairly I was treated. Went to the extent of appealing my grade with the dean. This is the one professor at the university I would not take again. Very dissatisfied. 
Lot of material class moves quickly took it over summer session. The final is cumulative, which is 12 chapters. Literally 12 chapter in 1 week to prepare for. What kind of dipsh*t makes a cumulative exam for a 300 level course?
I took him over this Winter for ECON308. You have to work hard for your grade but as long as you do the practice exams and follow along with his lectures, you will be fine.
Abrams is by far the worst economics professor at UD. He does not care about his students and is very bad at explaining things. To be fair he does know a lot about the subject, but is terrible at explaining it. The material is hard so have fun teaching it to yourself. Has office hours but they are almost as useless as going to class. Terrible.
Nice guy but he couldnt care less how you do in his class. His lectures are monotone and if you lose focus for a second youll be lost. The class is graded on 4 exams. He posts the slides on sakai and there is ONE practice exam for each exam. Other than that youre on your own, no hw to study from, only the book and slides you have to teach yourself
Horrible teacher. He is so boring in lecture that most students do not go because he reads right off of his slides that he later posts online. He relied on online practice tests and the tests were made up of questions from the online book/ he couldn't help us before the exams because he didn't even know what was on them. Didn't care to help anyone
I took his online class, taught it jointly with another professor.  Weekly test that cover the topics of that week.  Online lectures were good.  You can get through the test on the lectures alone but reading the material provided will be helpful.  I didn't find the class difficult, with a good understanding of the basic concepts you'll do well.
Well Abrams is a HORRIBLE professor and VERY condescending of students aren't ""smart"" about econ. Exams are hard, albeit he does provide practice exams. I do still find econ interesting overall, but honestly Abrams' attitude really ruined it entirely for me. Take this class with someone who knows how to respect his students, first and foremost
I would 100% not recommend this class; If there is any way to avoid taking Abrams for Econ, avoid him at all costs. He did not prepare us for the exams at all. He read of the slides in a monotone voice every class, which came from the Connect website to begin with, and based his exams on questions and ideas we never went over in class...
Reading is crucial and the tests are extremely difficult.  There are a few questions straight from the practice exam but that's out of 40-50 of them.  I took this during winter and that might be the time to do it if that's the only thing you are doing.  I would cry if I took this during the semester; if you are, I would look elsewhere.
He is monotone.  Class was okay. Didn't learn much. Exams are all multiple choice. He tries to help but can't. Going to office hours didn't work. I tried really hard but the exams are tricky. Try to get someone from his previous semester's class to get old exam. The exams are similar to the practice exams. He picks like 5-6 questions from there.
Terrible teacher, thinks he is going to change the world with his economic input.  Tries way too hard to be cool and talks down to people who do not know as much as him.  He makes the test questions confusing on purpose and admitted to that.  Don't take.
There is no point in going to class. All of his lectures are posted on UD Capture. The textbook can explain concepts better than he can. He teaches very slowly and is very boring. The exams are very straight forward and not too difficult. He will curve or offer extra credit on every exam. He also curves your grade at the end of the course.
This man is absolutely useless and by far the most unprofessional professor I have ever dealt with. Abrams deserves to loose his rights to ""teach"". I wish I could go more in debt about how bad this man is as a human, and a professor but I do not want him to screw me over anymore than he already has. But we will see what the dean thinks...
A classic example of a professor who's brilliant in his field but isn't much of a teacher.
The material is pretty boring but if you read the textbook and do the practice exams you should have no problem getting A's on the exams.
Absolutely loved him.  Definitely boring material and class attendance is not necessary, but if you read the book you'll be fine
Do not take this class with Abrams! He was so boring and does not curve at all. His exams are tricky. Ended up with a C+ in the class (my lowest grade ever). Avoid if possible.
Abrams is a really smart guy and a pretty good professor. Lectures are pretty boring. Exams are easy.
Boring,but he knows his stuff.Tests are rough and he emphasizes using calculus to derive formulas even though calculus is not a requirement for the class! It's BS, and when i told him I'm weak in calculus he said ""you better learn before the next exam"" Exams are rough 3 during semester and one cumulative final",Horrible experience. You have to work hard for your grade. He does not care about his students and is very bad at explaining things. He is so boring in lecture.  Exams are hard. He did not prepare us for the exams at all. Reading is crucial and the tests are extremely difficult. The material is pretty boring. He is monotone. Didn't learn much. 
604,"The course had a lot of components to it. For each quiz and midterm, articles, book chapters, and information covered in lectures could appear. 
I learned quite a to during this course and Prof. Miller would usually bring in guest speakers to show the students the world of journalism. His own lectures were filled with passion and hilarious. 
goes over lots of things in class that are interesting but none of it is on quiz/exam. Exams are long and hard to do with time constraint (pulled from 3+ different sources of information) including his own opinion. exams are not fair. poor grading but interesting lectures.
Definitely need to study for the exams and quizzes. There is no other homework, so make sure you od good on the exams
puts things on exams that are not are not discussed. Little to no assignments other than exams and asks questions that are seemingly impossible to find. Slides with notes are very minimal and he does not prepare you to succeed.
The highlight of my first semester freshman year! I loved meeting him at admitted students day and knew I had to take his class in the fall. Prof. Miller makes you laugh in every lecture and genuinely cares about your well-being as a student. Easy quizzes and exams. If you are a JMS major, he is a great resource. Take him at every chance you can!!
WHAT A GEM! Miller is a great guy who really cares about JMS and what he teaches. He is the backbone of JMS... let's be honest. If you can take a class with him... TAKE. IT! Super lenient with any issues, and works with you to make sure you get the most out of his classes.
Professor Miller's really kind and a good professor, but his class is only graded on three quizzes and two tests. So if you want a good grade you can't skip lectures and make sure you have the textbook. 
Miller makes lectures very fun and entertaining! However, your grade is only based on 3 quizzes, 2 midterms (50 questions each), and the final (100 questions). The latter two require reading many news articles and memorizing little details about each of them. Grades were heavily curved though, so I was able to pass. Be prepared to memorize!
This is actually one of the most ridiculous classes I have ever taken at rutgers. 3 exams and 3 quizzes which at first sounds fine but it is actually awful. These exams and quizzes have an extreme amount of information that you need to know before taking them. 50+ articles and textbook chapters that are over 100 pages each. It's too much info 
HONEST REVIEW: This class is an easy A if you work for it. While attending lectures is not required some of his questions say ""According to the professor."" questions come from the textbook so make sure to read the textbook. As for the articles DONT SLEEP ON THEM. 3 Quizzes 3 Exams. Class is curved where avg grade is around a C toB-. Very doable!
Really engaging lectures that will keep you interested throughout. Just study and take good notes and you will be fine. Three exams and three quizzes, no other assignments.
I loved professor miller for intro to media, exams and quizzes have a lot of material from lectures so you can't skip class (however powerpoints are on canvas) but his lecturers are interesting and he's a funny guy so it's not too bad. The exams are so easy if you look at the study guides he provides and at least skim the chapters, lots of vocab
Professor Miller is amazing! People don't attend the lectures so they complain they fail. Don't be surprised when I say this is a lecture heavy class. BUT, if you watch the lectures and take decent notes, this class is a fairly easy A. No trick questions, all are from his lectures. Sometimes even word for word!!
I had Miller fall 2020, everything was online. The lectures were long and manageable. He also assigns documentaries and a LOT of news articles. I had to read 50+ news articles for the final and 80% of the questions on the final were about those. DONT DISREGARD THE ARTICLES
Loved the material of the class, video lectures can be around an hour long each, book chapters can be up to 100 pages each (bc there are a lot of pictures). Miller is a very kind man and is willing to explain anything your confused on. Be prepared to work for the grade, also the book can be found online for free. Recommend making a studygroup!
No extra credit. Your whole grade is composed of your test and quiz grades. The class average was basically a 77. Apparently the highest it's ever been too. If the highest class average ever received was a 77, you'd think he would care enough to do something about it. If you don't go to lectures or read the textbook, you won't pass the class.
He was a great lecturer and i always felt bad when less people came to class. He was nice to students and had a flare for presentation. The tests are graded on a curve so you just have to be sure to study.
Prof Miller makes you work for your grade. However, we get told exactly what is on the exams the first day of class. I bought the textbook, but you don't need it, everything is online. If you begin familiarizing yourself with the info on the syll the first day of class, you will do AMAZING! He wants nothing more than for everyone to pass with A's
Amazing teacher and guy! Knows how to make the lectures engaging so that it doesnt feel too long. be prepared to read and memorize terms and articles though. I would take again :)
Nice guy, engaging, but class is useless. He cites from wikipedia. Tip: Textbook terms can be found on quizlet",goes over lots of things in class. Exams are long and hard to do with time constraint. if you want a good grade you can't skip lectures. Your whole grade is composed of your test and quiz grades. The tests are graded on a curve
608,"He is one of the best professor when it comes to teaching. He draws out stuff and explains well which is great since there are lot of professor who just read off the slides which could be boring. Professor Badri makes lecture interactive and fun. 
good style of teaching
If you want to learn OS, he is the guy.
Awesome prof. Explains everything well. lots of stuff on latest in OS. If you want to  do well in a job interview, take his class. I learnt about virtual machines.  very knowledgeable on latest trends in OS.
learnt a lot about OS. Gives the latest  on OS and what is important.  his last lecture on virtual machines  was  great. Makes a lot of effort in helping students get the concepts.
excellent professor
Maybe the most boring professor I've ever had. The sample exams aren't too similar to the real exams. If you can manage to pay attention, you will learn a lot about OS
This class is awful. He has his slides but none of them is related to projects. His practice exams are nothing like the real exams. The project was a huge long BitTorrent Client for a whole semester with no help from either the TA or him. Never reply emails in time. I sincerely don't think he cares about this class. Avoid this class!!
Probably the driest lecturer I've ever had. He scribbles illegible things on the whiteboard while droning on. None of his in class examples are fully thought out or explained well. His slides are useless. You have a better chance of winning the lottery then gauging what could be on the exam. The information that he tests you on is pure memorization
His lectures are boring. For our semester, he threw the BitTorrent project on us without warning, while saying he was going to change the project at the beginning of the semester. Project and lectures are not connected in any way so there's no point in going to class. He and the TAs don't really answer questions in a timely manner. Exams are okay.
He gives lots of reading assignments and all the tests are based on them. If you miss a class you pay. Overall, the course is heavy and needs time.
The entire class is one large group project split into three steps.  Attendance dwindled to pitiful numbers once everyone realized he posts the slides online before lecture. Recitation was even less useful. Exams are mostly memorization and the TAs usually give a good amount of partial credit. Java experience is a must for the project.
Lectures and slides are clear, if a bit boring. The project (bittorrent client) is pretty tough. You better know how to code large Java projects in groups of 2-3. The average grade right now is a 60, so there will probably be a large curve.
Super easy, funny, and makes sure everyone understands.  I didn't use the textbook; reading the slides is good enough.
Probably the best professor in CS
Nath isn't a bad professor, but I had a hard time paying attention to him in class.  Don't bring your laptop or you'll get WAY too distracted.  He makes a good number of mistakes, so be on the lookout.  I also wasn't very interested in the class beyond C and binary (I'm more of a software guy than a hardware guy), but he's alright...
Excellent Class, excellent prof.",Explains everything well. learnt a lot about OS. His practice exams are nothing like the real exams. His lectures are boring. The project (bittorrent client) is pretty tough. The information that he tests you on is pure memorization
611,"Professor Trivedi is an amazing professor. She provides excellent lectures that really aid class discussion, and while she grades tough, youll notice improvements almost immediately. I cant recommend her enough! Shes been a highlight of my semester.
Lisa is an amazing professor an extremely kind person. She cares about your education and is passionate about what she teaches. She's tough, but you will leave her class having learned a ton. Most of her poor reviews are from a long time ago, and I believe that she is now one of the best professors that you can find. I highly recommend taking her.
This professor is horrible. Does not make time for students, has no grading criteria, rather just reads your hard work and give you a random grade based upon her mood at the moment
Great professor who really cares about her students. She can be a tough grader but if you take advantage of office hours and ask questions in class you'll be fine.
Professor Trivedi is one of the best professors at Hamilton. She really cares about you and loves what she teaches. She gives the most passionate lectures. Yes, she can grade harshly, but that will push you to do well. Highly recommended.
Without a doubt one of the best profs at Hamilton. She'll kick your ass on writing and with the amount of reading, but it's definitely worth it and life-changing. She's one of the more theory-based folks in the dept, but still steeped in multiple disciplines and fields. Recommended if you want to work hard.
She is fantastic, hands down.  You want to see her outside of class because she is so cool.  Her lectures are overwhelming at times, so you should go to class expecting to take notes. She's a tough grader, but it's not too hard to get an A if you write well.
4 Years of Hamilton, worst professor I have ever had. Terrible teacher, worse at understanding students. If she didn't like the writing style of your first paper, either you were doomed, or had to confirm to her academic cult of pointless writing styles.
Fabulous teacher. Enough said. Highly recommended.
Be prepared to work, both for her time and for your grade.  One of the few professors i've met who will admot she's wrong on an issue and change her stance.
Thought-provoking, stimulated good discussion, opened my mind to new ways of thinking
Good prof, really nice, moderately hard grader and her lectures are decent
Good Teacher, But hard Grader
The worst professor I've had in my three years here, avoid her at all costs!","She provides excellent lectures. she grades tough. She gives the most passionate lectures. Good Teacher, But hard Grader"
612,"He's very nit-picky. Had him for a writing intensive course and he had very few comments related to content or structure, mostly choosing to focus on grammar or minor word choices. His grading was extremely arbitrary and inconsistent. Misses the forest for the trees on a lot of things. Has a dry sense of humor that's not for everyone.
Jones is extremely disorganized. My whole class struggled to get good grades. He gave out practice quizzes but they did not help at all with the real quizzes. For the most part I looked to the book and taught myself the course.
I took Macro with Jones. Econ does not come naturally to me, but he presented the material very clearly and follow the textbook exactly so it was easy to keep up.  Definitely take a class with him, he's a great professor
Took Comparative Economic Systems with Jones. He's a funny character but easy to like. Sometimes his lectures wander a bit but overall he is great. He knows his stuff and complements it well with his slightly odd British sense of humor. If you go to class and sorta know what the readings are about- the tests aren't that hard.
funny and a good humor every class. Joked about British things such as soccer. Helpful outside of class when needed clarification. Helpful during exams and admitted if something he taught was incorrect. Provided a good understanding of intro macro. Taught from textbook/in conjuncture with it, but the book wasn't particularly necessary.
Not bad, not great. Presents the material in a fairly clear manner and with a good sense of humor.
Funny guy if you get his type of humor, very intelligent and one of the most productive research economists. Always willing to help and good for a round at the Little Pub
His lectures are basically by the book, but a lot more confusing than the book. Tests are somewhat difficult but he's an easy grader, so they balance out. I'd go for a different teacher, but maybe not.
Very engaging, knows his econ.
A coolass dude.  Like the professor from Gilligan's Island
Good teacher, however the tests are difficult and sometimes do not pertain to the information that is thoroughly taught.
not a great teacher, exams are difficult based on classes
By far the best Econ professor I've ever had.
Awesome guy and teacher
I recommend him highly.  He's a jolly bloke",His grading was extremely arbitrary and inconsistent. He's a funny character but easy to like. Provided a good understanding of intro macro. Presents the material in a fairly clear manner and with a good sense of humor.
613,"This is two classes in one, one standard and one amazing. First there's the normal stuff. Learn things in lectures, show you learned them. Okay. The second part is case studies, which was a student presentation followed by a sort of moderated debate; Extremely engaging, educational, and generally awesome. I wish more professors would do that!
Probably the worst professor I've ever had. Lecture tests are based off miniscule information that he has on his handouts, and you have to answer the question exactly how it is on the handout to receive credit. For his chapter tests, if the answer isn't in the book, it's wrong even if it's right. It's not about what we know, but what the book said.
Although intimidating at first, if your a management major, I highly advise to take any of his classes. He is very knowledgeable and helpful. He makes the classroom lectures based on real life experiences. Only problem was a quiz every week got tiring.
Avoid if possible.  Not only will this man do his best to make your life miserable, he'll do his best to make you feel stupid while doing it.  Unreasonable expectations and he will express  his disgust when you fall short.  Class was one group project split into 4 parts.  The only was I survived was by having a good group! Pray you get one too.
Margulis is the worst professor I've experienced at Grand Valley. He encourages student participation and is rude/interrupts when they talk and doesn't hear what they have to say. For the sake of your sanity/education, just avoid him.
His tests can be hard, but he gives LOTS of options - you have to answer a certain amt of points that you choose. He's funny and entertaining, but sometimes can be taken the wrong way. Overall, I think he was a great professor and had a great experience with this class.
He's entertaining without a question and has a lot of history with HR, but when it comes to grading exams he's the worst. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking to boost your grade up.
tests are not very hard as long as you read the book and he gives you options of what problems to do the the tests...in box memos are pointless and participation is worth too much
The first day of class I wasn't sure what to expect, but he ended up being a great professor. He is actually very understanding, and if you study for his tests you'll do well. His grading is extremely fair, and if you put the time and effort into the class, you'll do well.
He doesn't verbalize expectations. He assumes students know about management before we even start the class. His in-box exercises are pointless. I didn't learn anything from them... choose a better teacher!
If you participate in class, come to class, and get involved it's a very simple class.  The only thing bringing me down is his exams but if you study hard you will get a good grade.  The in-box memo's are fairly easy after you figure out how he grades.  Got an 86, 95, and then 100 on them so not too bad really.  Take him if you want to learn.
He's Terrible!  Tests are totally out there. The tests cover the book, but each tests covers 6 to 7 chapters and he doesn't give you a study guide.  Class time is reserved for lecture (which has NOTHING to do with the book) and in box memos. The inbox memos are pretty stupid as well. They make you think, sure, but found them pointless. Stay away!
As long as you know the information on the study guides and handouts you will get a good grades on the tests. He may seem a little harsh the first week but as you go through the semester you find out he is really nice. The in-box memos can be hard but if you take a few hours on them and watch your mechanics you should do well. Will take him again.
Yes this class is hard- so if you don't want to work for your grade then stay away.  However, he is a great professor who really knows what he's talking about.  He offers great examples and his class truly helps prepare you for a career in business.
If you can help it, don't take him at all.  There are plenty of other profs that will actually teach you something about management.  Memo assignment is stupid- his class should be SWS with all that writing we had to do for minute points!
Not an easy class no matter who you have.  In-Box Exercise is a pain, but it can be helpful.  He does grade on length, which is stupid. Over all I thought the class was hard, but I did learn quite a bit in it.  His exams are hard, one exam - two separate parts over two days, cut us some slack.
This guy is an idiot.  Take you're typical egotistical colloge professor and multiply it.  Even if you can figure out what this****is saying it won't help, I don't think he even has a clue what's coming out of his mouth.  Oh, and the papers graded solely on length?  Yeah, good idea, cause that's how the real world works....
Worst professor in my 5 years at gvsu. AVOID HIM.  If there is any professor that cares less, its him.  Absolutely the worst professor at GVSU, he should be removed.
Horrible!  Avoid.  Hopefully management of diversity is not still used to kill two classes for the price of one.  It's worth it to not have to sit through Margulis' class!!!","Probably the worst professor I've ever had. He doesn't verbalize expectations. this class is hard. His exams are hard.

614,"BY FAR BEST HISTORY CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN, I've taken two classes from Professor Williams and both were utterly amazing. He gives very interesting lectures and only asks of you to take notes and read your textbook.  He is very caring and understanding and I believe everyone can get something good out of taking his class :)
Absolutely love Dr. Williams! He's such a fun lecturer and I find myself laughing many times throughout class. Tests can be a little difficult if you don't prepare beforehand, especially the essay questions, but the answers to the review come mostly from his lectures. There's 2 projects you have to do as well but other than that no other work 
Great Guy and almost a better teacher!! Will take him multiple times during my college years!!
Take his classes. Thats all. Not much more to be said other than he was quite literally the best prof. I've ever had. That man can teach.
A great guy that really cares for his student and does his best to relate the material to you. Although I was really tuned in sometimes, other times the material got a bit unwieldy and it became hard to keep up. The tests often felt disconnected from the lectures as well, or at least had x10 the info. Although I suppose thats not really his fault.
Loved his class! Such a great Prof. Really knows his stuff. I would definitely listen in class because he says some listed things that are on the exam and not specifically stated in the textbook.
Williams is nice enough, and I really like that he has projects along with exams. He's just, well, boring. He never has discussions, and considering we've all taken American History at least 2x before, it's annoying he only does the basics. This is a class that could be really cool-don't waste it on this guy. All the answers are APUSH answers, FYI.
Fantastic Professor. Energetic and engaging. Makes class excited and easy to remember. Very helpful on quizzes and projects are easy.
Really knows his history and is very passionate about teaching. He gives you study guides to help with test, and will always make sure the students know what's coming up in his class.
Dr. Williams is tough, but he not only knows so much about American Church History- he is also a gifted teacher. He does not ""give"" any grade, but makes you work for it. He's incredibly well read and traveled, and makes history come to life. He cares more about you understanding the concepts and history than memorizing dates.
I've taken him twice. He's a tough grade, and strict on late grades, but he gives great feedback. Always do a little more than what you think he expects. He's the funniest professor I've had, and keeps class interesting and exciting. He usually falls behind on the schedule and removes a paper. Super passionate about his courses too. Very genuine.
I absolutely adored him for American Church History. The class difficulty was as expected, but he makes it super clear what you need to study and do to earn the grade you desire. I love how he applies what you are learning as he goes... lots of good sermons. Super great guy!
Williams is seriously an amazing professor! He really cares about his students and takes the time to learn every student by name! His lectures are really interesting and he makes them fun! There really isn't any homework in this class, but there are weekly quizzes (so easy)! The tests are all writing, but just study and you'll be fine.
Dr. Williams is by far one the best professors at DBU. Very engaging classroom lectures/discussions. He is very knowledgeable and personable. He cares about the material and about the students.
I was in Dr. Williams history class and his classes were fun and full of stories. Each story literally explained about the topic really well that even I, who wasnt from the US got to understand things easily. The way he conducts the class was clear so I had no confusion or troubles staying on track. Im definitely going to take his class again!
Dr Williams is THE best teacher I have ever had. There is work but its all very easy if you just take the time to study, he tells you to read but you dont need to if you prepare yourself for quizzes/tests. If youre good at memorizing, youll be fine! Keep up w/ quizzes because those will be on the test!
He is great. He literally tells you what to study so that you dont waste your time. I highly recommend him. He genuinely cares for his students and is a sweet man.
Dr. Williams is a fantastic professor! He makes history so interesting and he is very caring.
Take advantage of his extra credit! He's an awesome prof, I loved him! He talks a lot but its engaging conversation, he likes class participation. If you go to class, pay attention, study for quizzes, and write down everything he writes on the board, you will be solid. He tells you exactly what will be on the exams, I had no problem making an A
Great guy, lectures alot but it's not to bad at all. If you study and show up it shouldnt be a problem, he's also got some great stories and i found him very engaging.","He is very caring and understanding. He's such a fun lecturer.

615,"Difficult course,  expects students to study a lot and do problems from the back of the book. Tests are very difficult and very tricky. Very helpful and dedicated to his students.
LOVED this professor! Chemistry is one of the hardest courses at OSU regardless of who teaches it, but Rockley is definitely the professor you want.  He is funny, interesting, very smart, and he WILL HELP YOU OUT. Go to his office hours, do homework, and just chat; this will get you brownie points.  His tests are hard but he curves! GREAT TEACHER.
Totally skipped class often because he never taught anything that mattered for the test. I took AP Chem in high school and had to use those notes to study because his were a mess. He's a cool guy though and pretty entertaining. Tests are brutal and way too hard so he curves it like crazy. He uses his labs to boost grades.
So amazing. Probably the neatest individual I've ever met, or ever will meet. Part teacher, part inspirer, part encourager, part friend, part father-figure. If he could teach every course in my 4 yrs here, id pay double. i can honestly say i LOVE learning because of him.
Such an incredible teacher. My whole outlook on being in college and what i want to do with my life changed because of him. I've never felt so encouraged or empowered. Forget the chem, its worth taking this class just to get to know such an incredible human being. I have to take 11515 but refuse until i can take it with Rockley.
Dr. Rockley is the most awesome professor ever, but probably the most difficult. I took it my first semester as a freshman and he scared me really bad. I took the class with 17 hours and I survived. I ended up with a B, which was great. You will learn a lot from him, but STUDY HARD.I basically spent two hours each day READING THE BOOK!!!!!
The Chem class he was teaching was difficult, so I can't rag on him too much.  He did try his best to help students, and often gave bonus points and curves.  But his lectures often didn't help you prepare for the test.  The first test average was about 42.  Like I said, hard class, but he could've done better teaching.
Dr. Rockley is a good professor who is willing to truly help his students, but I did not appreciate how he overwhelmed us with studying. Exams are difficult, giving me the lowest grades I have encountered so far. There is a massive curve and bonus points. If you take his class, take a lighter load (unlike me with 13 other hours in addition to 1515)
Very condescending, didn't enjoy him as a person. Tries to scare the students by making them think they will fail. Just read the book and do the problems in the back and you should get a B. Didn't go to class to often due to his elitism tone.
Dr. Rockley is an incredible guy who reallyyy cares about his students. The class is very tough, but he will do anything to help you get a good grade. He is always willing to answer questions and has a ton of office hours. The book will be your best friend, it requires a lot of studying, but hard work pays off. Take Rockley!
Dr. Rockley has a great passion for teaching and making sure everyone understands the material, even if he has to repeat it over and over and over..However, students take advantage and ask irrelevant questions..which he answers. It REALLY wastes a lot of class time but other than that he is a great professor, super office hours great help
Dr. Rockley is just an incredible person. His love for teaching and passion to truly see kids succeed will blow you away. I've never felt so encouraged or enabled, but after a week in his class you feel like you can conquer the world. Study hard and you'll be far ahead of your peers in other teacher's classes, esp. if you're a premed TAKE ROCKLEY!
omg he is the funniest science teacher alive. your stomach will be hurted, i laughed a lot. the class is extremely difficult though but he's very helpful. you need to ask as many question as possible. try to understand the material in advance. dont memorize or youll be dead on the final.
I absolutely LOVED this class and Dr.Rockely is fabulous.  It is a very, very difficult class but Rockley will do everything in his power to help you succeed.  He obviously truly cares for his students and wants to help in any shape or form. You must do your part as well though. Follow the advice he gives you from day one!
Extremely difficult class with a lot of work each section. Great teacher with a wonderful personality, but he's hard to understand because of the speed of the class. He will do anything for his students, even give us extra credit if we catch a mistake. He recommends 1.5 hours a day of studying.If you try, you'll make a B easily, if not, farewell :)
You will learn chemistry on a world class level if you take his course seriously. The tests are difficult, but he will literally do anything for his students, he wants you to succeed. Easy to get to know and you will enjoy his class.
I hated Chemistry before Rockley. Humorous in class, really wants you to succeed. Gives examples of applied chemistry and engineering that are interesting. Definitely requires studying, though. Do the homework, read the text, take notes, go to the study sessions; basically everything he tells you, and then you'll do great. But again, fantastic prof
He is the BEST. His class is extremely difficult but it's completely possible to get a high A. He gives so students several opportunities to raise grades. He wants everyone to actually learn and do well. Do exactly what he says and GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! He is my favorite professor I have ever had
This guy is awesome. Make no mistake, though - if you don't do EVERYTHING he says from day one, you'll spend the whole semester after exam 1 just trying to catch up. Don't take this class with a demanding schedule - it requires at least two hours a day of study. Be dedicated!
Outstanding teacher. He throughly explains what you need to know. His curves are great and he wants to help his students get A's. He also has test reviews a few days before his exams which are extremely helpful!","Difficult course. Tests are very difficult and very tricky.

617,"Abhyankar is very kind and helpful when you ask questions. However, he is VERY lecture-heavy and tends to ramble/doesn't make it very clear what your learning objectives are or what you need to focus on. The only assignments he gave all semester were a couple of 5-page papers with little to no instruction. I learned almost nothing.
Barely had any assignments, the lectures were not interesting to me and were boring. Easy class though.
It's kinda difficult to communicate with him at times. It seems like he doesn't understand what I'm saying. He's a fair grader and will help with assignments though.
This is the third class I took with this professor. Attendance isn't mandatory and so, you'll never find more than five students in the class at any point of time. He gives a lot of pop quizzes but they don't really count for the final grade. Most of the questions on the final comes from those quizzes though.
Very Helpful
Great Teacher, Excellent and very helpful
Great prof!
I think most people have a problem with this professor because he actually expects work outside of class, which most ISU students don't even understand how to do. You are not at school to be taught at by a professor you are at school to LEARN from a professor. Asking questions and common sense are requirements to succeed in this class.
Worst professor ever I had.
Useless teacher...not clear what so ever.
He is helpful & does have an accent. Thats why I sat in the front row -I could hear him perfectly. He went over everything we needed to know that was going to be on the tests. The tests were hard! I failed all of them and still passed the class with a C+; so he does curve the class dramatically!! So don't think about dropping because you WILL pass!
Like everyone else, did not have a clue to what was going on in the class. He has a very thick accent and is hard to understand. Teaches very fast paced. I am an A/B student and dropped the class. If this class is required for you, take a different professor.
Horrible class. Had know idea what was going on. Cant understand what he is saying. Tests and quizzes were impossible. I am an A student and i dropped this classs
He is so nice and very helpful.  If you get lost or fall behind while he is teaching he will stop and come over to your computer and help you.  He is kind of hard to get a hold of outside of class but if you are taking cs 101 I STRONGLY recommend taking him - he's great!
He does all the work, step by step on his computer as long as you follow him you will get all the assignments done or you can follow the book. I thought the book was hard to understand. If you go to class you will be fine. There was only a midterm & final all the questions are straight from the book and he tells you what chapters to study. Nice guy
I LOVED THIS PROF!! I couldnt really understand too much of what he was saying but he is pretty funny to listen to. Easy class just do the work.
Hard to understand, but helpful when asked.  Quizzes and tests are hard, but I still ended up getting an A because I think he curved them. CS 151
He is very hard to understand because of his heavy accent, but do not let that scare you off. This class is very easy. All you have to do is finish your assignments, they do not even have to be on time! Come to class for the quizzes, but he gives you the answers ahead of time. EASY class!
Hard to understand
Just do ur work n its easy.. the book explains it all you dont have to understand what his saying..","Very Helpful. Great Teacher, Excellent. The tests were hard! He has a very thick accent and is hard to understand. Teaches very fast paced. He is kind of hard to get a hold of outside of class. "
619,"Quiz questions are easy...he gives the answers ahead of time. However, his tests are extremely hard and you never know what to study. His review questions are different than the questions on the tests. Study hard for this class based on his notes!
Give quiz questions ahead of time with answers. Helpful. Tells good stories..
Great professor...had him for an honors class. I hated biology until I took his class. No homework, the textbook was online, gives easy extra credit.  But you will have to answer questions in class. Overall he's awesome.
A great guy! Class is not easy, he expects a lot out of his students! Really cares about his students! GO TO STUDY SESSIONS!!!! He gives credit to those who go! He makes class interesting and he's pretty funny, which can be a +. Also, he likes class participation and will pick people, there IS NO hiding!
Great guy! Really cares about your education. The man has been alive since the Lincoln administration though.
Wonderful guy- very helpful in review sessions and is entertaining in class. Pleasure to learn from.
He is one of the best biology teachers.  You definitly have to go to the study sessions.  The tests are difficult, but if you get old tests to study from they questions are similar from year to year, but not all of them.  I learned a ton from him.
By far the best biology teacher I have ever had. Even though his class is hard... it is a class that you will absolutely learn something from. Study sessions are a must... and DO ALL EXTRA CREDIT assigned... trust me ... you'll need it! Great class overrall... you get your $ worth! :)
Funny little old man.
A lot of work this class is! If you go the the review sessions though you should be just fine! I got A's in both classes ;-)
Very hard tests, long lectures, but you can learn something from this course. You only need to read to do well and ask for study sessions before the tests.
utterly and irresistibly sweet
He's tough, but you can take away so much more from this class than you would think is possible.  He is one sexy hunk of meat!
He's a funny little man! His tests are confusing, but if you go to the reviews, it really helps.
Why show up to his class all his notes are online. lecture doesn't really help u can read the notes at home. his tests are hard and confusing. he eats WORMS. too bad he's the only lifs 101 and 102 teacher.:D
From the old school, but if you do your work he will be very supportive.
Clear cut lectures, very challenging tests
Knows all the tricks of the trade
If you take notes, you will do fine.","Quiz questions are easy. Class is not easy, he expects a lot out of his students! Great guy! You definitly have to go to the study sessions. The tests are difficult. long lectures, but you can learn something from this course."
626,"So sad Dr. D is retiring! I would have loved to take him again.
Dr. derrick knows what he is teaching, but his lectures are very boring. He is not always very clear either. He is nice and approachable.
Dr. Derrick made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I had a 78% right before the final paper. I ended with a D- overall. That's more than a letter grade. He tells you that he didn't receive your work even though you have proof that you gave it to him. He is horrible and I refuse to take him ever again.
I've always done well in English so I figured this class wouldn't be too bad. Boy was I wrong, Dr. Derrick is the most unclear professor out there. I spent hours studying for his tests and would fail them. If you don't think exactly like him, you won't do well. Still trying to figure out 1 thing I've learned from the class, avoid this prof.
Dr. Derrick is a professor I admire greatly. I know that a lot of my classmates thought he graded harshly but I disagree. I really respect him as a professor and he is very intelligent. He went to Harvard and by just listening to his lectures it's pretty obvious. I enjoyed his class and his jokes. 
Absolutely wonderful! He loves what he teaches and makes it apparent. Attendance is a must- he drops hints as to what will be of great importance on the test. His tests are long but easy if you did the reading and took notes in class. I definitely recommend him!
I have never dropped a class or got anything less than an A in a class before this class.  Derrick was an incapable prof, did not explain the course at all and I am still confused on what the class is even about. Do NOT take this class! He makes no sense in lectures, will put you to sleep and you will not get the grade you want from him. AVOID!!!
Dr. D is a great professor, but he is often severely misunderstood. He comes from a different pedagogical background than most profs. If you are looking for someone easy, you need to look elsewhere. He will challenge you, and if you are passionate and willing to put forth the effort, you will really grow as a student in his class.
Dr. D's teaching was as good as his sense in ties (poor).  When a student stated that he ""hit his writer's wall, and needed help."" Dr.D replied ""Define the shape and go around it"" Absolutely useless.  One of our many paper was a ""narrative of our hometown geology."" Unless you truly enjoy bird watching, get out! started with 15 students ended with 5
I did not enjoy this class. The material was interesting and he did know what he was talking about. What bothered me the most was his tests. They were over nothing we covered in class, and his study guides gave us useless information that we never ended up using. I like him as a person but not a professor.
A little difficult, but that's the course material, and not Dr. D; he's a very good teacher and attendance pays off! It's not required, but it's highly recommended because class discussions cover more than the book and the tests are made to make sure you've been going to class. Go to class, do the reading(in all the books), and take good notes..
Although Dr. D is certainly eccentric, only a very lazy person would say he has no business teaching a freshman composition. I wouldn't be able to crank out half the papers I've written in college if it weren't for him. He does so much to help you. Really approachable, good guy. But it's just like any other class: you earn your grade.
DON""T TAKE IT!!! It's wayyyy too hard! Get out while you can! I hated this class! It had some good points but it was not worth it!!!!
Great guy. You do have to put in the work, but if you go to class and pay attention then you're golden
The smartest man at ISU and so much fun!
Dr. D really helped me.
Dr. Derrick is seriously way too smart for his students. His assignments are always way out there and we students struggle to understand. When we don't grasp the entire concept he counts off points. I had him 5 days a week and honestly I freaked out because I KNEW I wouldn't know anything. I never felt dumb until I took his courses.
Dr. D is a pretty nice guy.  He's a pretty easy grader.  His class and the material you cover is soooo boring.  I's crazy.  I do not believe this class should be mandatory for education majors.
Worthless class.  It should not be mandatory.  Don't take him.
He's nuts, but if you read and take VERY GOOD NOTES, you'll be fine.  Not recommended for non-English majors.","knows what he is teaching, but his lectures are very boring. He makes no sense in lectures. The material was interesting and he did know what he was talking about. You do have to put in the work "
627,"She is the worst, and she makes you not want to interact in class. Scheduled out of class exams when we had no exam note for the class. she was average but she was just not encouraging. she told everyone there was no jobs in marketing majors in a business class? why would you ever say that. AVOID HER
Avoid this professor at all costs. I knew the material forwards and backwards for every single exam and the highest grade that I ever got was a B. Not worth it. Lectures are very boring and don't directly reflect exams. Homework is given which is a grade booster but isn't not on exams either. Overall an unfair/unreasonable course. Do NOT take!!!
Rita is a very nice lady who wants you to do well. She does care a lot. She provides detailed notes so you don't have to read the textbook. However, the concepts are hard to understand and the exams are difficult. Does not really explain the concepts that much. Instead, we just answer clicker questions for almost the entire period. 
ACCT 363 was a very easy way to receive 3 credits and boost your GPA. I would definitely recommend taking. You have to volunteer for 32 hours and help individuals fill out their tax returns.
Although this was a tough class for me, she had many easy opportunities to get extra credit. Her lectures were handed out as note which was very helpful. A TON of clicker questions. Her exams were really hard. I did not like her so much as a person but I respected as a professor because she had us practice so much until we got it all down
Cook is the worst professor I have ever had. She expects you to follow her hand outs which are complete gibberish. She expects you to learn from her scrolling through a word document which seems to be in a foreign language. Take Vanleer he is awesome and actually cares his about the students. 
Her motto after every test was ""a ""C"" is a good grade"" although that may seem concerning at first, if you really study it is definitely possible to get over a ""C,"" plus with the amount of extra credit she gives in class it is very possible to get a good grade in the class. 
Rita is fantastic! Definitely take this class it it very possible to get that A! I think she is very helpful and makes everything really easy to understand in lecture. Please take her she is amazing and if you put in the work you will do just fine. 
My biggest mistake was taking this woman for intro to accounting. She is lazy and unclear in all her lectures. Her homework is fine, but won't help you for exams. Prepare to answer a clicker question in under 10 seconds. If you have her, proceed with caution, and study hard. 
This is simply a tough course, and she does a decent job of trying to make the class doable. Lots of clicker points, so class is good to go to. Exams are very difficult which is why classwork is worth so much. She does really care and does everything she can to help. Decent professor, but don't expect an easy grade.
She is a very nice woman and very helpful. She truly cares about her students.
She's a great teacher. It really isn't a hard class. I got straight Cs on the exams and ended up with a B in the class. She gives a lot of extra point with clickers so be sure to go to class to get those. She's an all around nice person.
She is great. She gives us pleaty of extra points.It is easy to get a good grade eventhought you didn't do well in exam.
Had her for winter session and she was fantastic. Great notes- made it easy to learn the material.
What a terrible teacher. Her notes and class is as confusing as possible and worst of all she hates answering students questions. She laughs and mimics kids who answer questions for way more time then it would take to answer the question. I not only suggest not taking her, I suggest not associating with her-shes a bad person
Got all my lowest test grades of college in her class. I am usually a great student, but with Kingery you could expect tons of unrelated work, confusing tests and pointless class periods. I strongly suggest taking another teacher.
Albeit she provides hundreds of pages of typed notes, they are actually very useful if you print them out and organize them properly. She doesn't spend enough time actually going over concepts, but rather uses that time for clicker questions. She can come across as mean in class, but in smaller review sessions she is approachable and helpful.
STAY AWAY! THE OTHER TEACHERS ARE FAR BETTER. Shes a nice lady and all and will try to help you but the other teachers are far better and give far less work.
Her exams are way harder than any other professors. A lot of busy work and you have to teach yourself most of the material. I only passed 1 exam and still passed the class.
Rita is fabulous! Accounting in general hard to understand at first, but she gives homework and many in class examples to help you understand! Also gives online homework and quizzes which are easy and help you at the end of the semester. You can get a C on each test and still wind up with a B if you do extra credit! TAKE RITA",Avoid this professor at all costs. Lectures are very boring. the concepts are hard to understand and the exams are difficult. Her notes and class is as confusing. A lot of busy work and you have to teach yourself most of the material.
628,"As a lecturer, all he did was ramble from tangent to tangent, read aloud from the NY Times, and push his own theory of Cosmopolitanism. I knew better than to ask for guidance on papers from him, but I had several peers claim that when they came to him with their own ideas, he would shoot them down in favor of his own ""solutions."" Awful.
I took this course many years ago, but still remembers clearly how helpful, knowledgeable, and accessible Professor Sanders was. Topics in this course were controversial and must have been difficult to manage for the teacher, but Professor Sanders did an excellent job. In addition, he was very helpful when I asked questions during office hours.
I loved this class. Was it challenging?yes,but ultimately what I learned has helped me understand concepts in other classes. For this class I did all of the readings and studied a significant amount for the tests (which were hard). What helped was to go to the review sessions with the GSI's..don't miss those!
I love this class. I think the professor is really passionate about everything he teaches. For the test you have to study really hard; yet its not impossible. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in how policy is shaped.
Professor Sanders is a very intelligent man. He is extremely knowledgeable on the subject that he teaches. His lectures are dry and it can be boring, however, if you listen intently you will actually learn a lot of things! My suggestion: visit him during office hours! He's a nice guy and will be very helpful as long as you go see him.
A good class. Starts mediocrely but is improving strongly during the semester. Take him seriously: if you read all the material intensively, you'll get much out of the course. Good explanation of complex theories. Sometimes I missed a more critical account of his own views but he is definitely open for critique. More discussion time would be great.
Sanders is the reason why I, a liberal, started to dislike Berkeley. He is so biased and his class is so boring that most people surf the web and later switch to P/NP, after getting killed on tests by unqualified, bratty 'readers.' The 2nd worst class I took as undergrad (1st one being R. Holub's class). Don't take it or drop it like it's hot.
Sanders is an inquisitive and interesting professor. Definitely go to office hours because that is where you will learn the most. Despite previous comments, Sanders is the most humble teacher I have met on this campus. Really. He knows his stuff and stands by it, but maintains humility. He would carry your bag for you if it was too heavy.
The worst class I took at Berkeley.  He can spend the entire class rambling, yet never clearly explaining the idea.  The reader is almost useless because it is so vauge.  This class had so much potential, and I was so excited to take it, but now I'm just glad I'm almost out of the department.
Any one who can keep him/herself fully participated in this class from day one to final is GOD! Because this class is SOOOO boring and Sanders is without a doubt my worst professor at Cal. And the fact that such person can be the chair of the dept. is just the misery of the US education system.
Rambles a lot, a lot of the lectures follow the readings but very boring unfortunately, mid-term is take home, final study questions are semi-helpful, there is a lot of reading. On the tests, and the paper, grading is very subjective.
Sanders is a partisan, but he is hardly arrogant and never cruel to his students. What does merit criticism are the films he shows in class. They are freaking depressing! And the grading is a little harsh, but acceptable if you have done the work. I suspect that the spiteful posts have been written by students who performed poorly on the exams.
As an unbiased student, I feel that this professor is the ultimate ****. Not only is he affected by the Napoleon complex, but his arrogance is crippling to   his teaching quality and the learning environment. He commonly takes pride in humiliating students- his sense of humor is at the expense of his students.
Lectures are unstructured and insubstantive. He claims to be ""outside the box"" only to spew Obama rhetoric and pretend it means Gramsci; deconstructs absolute Truth only to assert his own discursive regime. Leaves behind solid analysis of either theory or events to evangellicaly self-affirm his camp. Extreme lack of nuance and earnest reflexivity.
The class deals with real issues the world is facing and people must confront. Some of his students apparently can't face that reality. Sanders is a great teacher. Lectures are fascinating- my friends even sit in on them. Readings informative & equally as interesting. Sanders is very fair. Opinionated but welcomes challenge. Helpful, if sought out.
Lectures were interesting. Great readings, but can get tiring after a while. Made me think. But, Sanders is an ****. Is arrogant, condescending, self-righteous. No one is allowed to disagree with him. Treats students as if they are ignorant and inferior Believes his word is law. At times scope on subject was limited. Easy but be cautious of him.
I agree with the guy below me. I'm in his class now and maybe he's cleaned up his act, but I find the class really informative and not as slanted as everyone claims. It's not a boring class at all because he gives you history from a different perspective. The midterm was rough though..at least for me.
I am in his class currently and I guess I don't think he's as bad as everyone else does. I have learned a lot about American hypocrisy and violence, and I think he does a great job of supporting his lectures with articles, quotes, historical documents, etc. He is pretty extreme, but I think taking a critical look at American history is important.
I did not learn one piece of information from that class and i went to class everyday. He is extremely boring. This is by far the worst class i took in my entire time at Cal.
stupidest class i've ever taken.  honestly, this was a waste of time.  his lectures have no structure.  he just rants.  i can't believe this guy is department chair.",He is extremely knowledgeable on the subject that he teaches. His lectures are dry and it can be boring. Rambles a lot. a lot of the lectures follow the readings. Lectures are unstructured and insubstantive. The midterm was rough.
634,"If you are a NRM or BIO major, I would recommend taking another elective course. Tbh this course isn't that useful in the business world. The content is rather bland. Non-mandatory attendance, but I promise you that you will fail if you don't show up to the labs.
If you think a hour and fifteen minute lecture on soils isn't going to be boring sometimes well then you're wrong. Mel is an awesome dude, but he is old as dirt....I mean soil. He cannot hear well and takes some time to explain things but if you listen you will learn. He is awesome at office hours and puts out study guides for all the exams.
This was the most backwards, delusional, flat out awful class I have ever taken at GVSU. Mel might be the most confusing man I have ever met in my entire life. I would not recommend taking this class unless you enjoy having no clear direction with the task at hand and you like to sit through a 3 hour lab that could be finished in 5 minutes.
Mel is a very nice guy, but probably shouldn't be teaching this class anymore. He expects you to know everything in the textbook without saying that at the beginning of class. He lectures and doesn't go over everything and mostly wants you to teach the class to yourself. The average for the final was an F! And he doesn't curve anything in his class
Hello NRM majors. Buckle up and get ready for a bumpy ride. Unfortunately, Prof. Mel Northup is the only professor that teaches soils. Attending lecture is CRITICAL to passing this class. Sleeping in/ not reading the book? You won't pass. I worked my butt off in this class and managed to pinch a B+. Study hard for this class kiddos!!
Mel is such a sweet old man! He spent 2 HOURS going over material with me to prep for an upcoming exam & the next week he spent nearly 2 additional hours helping me figure out which classes I should be taking from now until graduation (& he is'nt even my advisor!) His lectures are dry but if you seek help, he will be more than happy to assist you!!
I am an NRM major. He makes power points but jumps all around and does not change the slide. Reads the book for his lecture. Lots of information to take in. I am a Dean's List Student and this is one of the harder classes. Concepts and soils are easy to understand but the calculations and soil taxonomy parts of his lectures are awful.
Yea, lets have a 50 year old guy teach an online course, that makes sense. This guy was born before computers were invented. Harsh grader, and poor assignment explanations. DO NOT TAKE ONLINE CLASS
Dr. Northup's teaching style is unusual, but once you get the hang of it his classes are a breeze. He literally posts any and all content you need on blackboard, his office hours are extremely flexible, and he presents every idea in approx 100 different ways so there's no chance you will misunderstand
The people who complain about professor Northup or this class are the same people who don't read the textbook or participate in class discussion. Professor Northup is very friendly and usually explains concepts very clearly. If you read the textbook and show up to his class, you will do well.
Mel is a VERY helpful professor. His lectures come right from the book, and he is always willing to help. His lectures can be boring because he primarily lectures, but the material is very interesting.His labs are usually interesting videos that relate to the lecture and help you understand.The exams can be a little challenging.Study+go to class=A
First of all, Mel is one of the nicest professors I've ever had. He really cares about his students and wants them to do well in his class and in life! However, his lectures are incredibly boring. He basically reads from the textbook and tends to spend a TON of time on easy concepts. The exams are surprisingly hard but if you study you'll be fine!
Prof. Northup is great at his job. He teaches the material, then tests you over it. If you go to all the lectures and labs and take some time to study for the tests the class will be a piece of cake.
This class would have been extremely easy except for the exams which were harder than the ACT. The labs are a piece of cake but the lectures are incredibly boring. He's a really nice guy, but his exams are so hard and nothing like the lectures!
Not a clear communicator! Nice Guy! Exams are not easy. Lectures seem useless. Wish i could have had a better prof!
This prof was horrible. His exams were incredibly hard and the study guide was absolutely no help. I would never recommend him to anyone. He is the nicest person ever though. He just is not the greatest prof.
Mel is a great professor. If you go to all the lectures then you will do good on exams. It was an easy gen ed. The labs are easy other than the field trips (movies).
Not the easy Gen. Ed. everyone expects it to be. Its interesting, but class average is 70% on every exam and he doesn't curve. He is like a really nice grandpa, but there is no reason to go to a single lecture. Straight from the book.
Mel is a nice man, pretty funny at time, awkward at other times. Keeps you in class for the entire time...don't be fooled by his first quiz, the exams do get harder. Positive correlation between attendance and grades!
Awful, didn't explain things, hard. I'm a dean's list student and I got a C. He was the worst professor ever.","The content is rather bland. He expects you to know everything in the textbook without saying that at the beginning of class. Attending lecture is CRITICAL to passing this class. Harsh grader, and poor assignment explanations. his lectures are incredibly boring."
636,"Tao is one of my favorite professors that I have had. He can be hard to understand at some points, but he seems to know what he is talking about and is good at teaching the information. He is very soft-spoken and he has an accent so sometimes it is hard to understand what he is saying. I would recommend sitting in the front.
He is very helpful.
Lots of these reviews are outdated. I'm a science major and it was my first computer class. Sit close to the front as he is soft spoken. But overall, if you do pay attention during lecture you will do just fine. The CIS tutoring centering is very useful too if you are having trouble with the material. Work with other classmates!
Professor Tao is a decent professor. He's very softly spoken so it can be difficult to understand him unless you are focused. During labs he is always available for help. He also might not cover certain aspects of a concept if they aren't relevant to the lesson or course, so you should ask questions for clarification.
Easy going guy. Straight forward with what is expected. He gives a few computer exams and a few written exams. Even if you don't do so hot on the exams, there are enough lab activity points that make up for it. I stopped going to most lectures after the first month or so and still got an easy A. You do have to go to lab though.
He is very soft spoken so sit near the front. He teaches material in a simple and straightforward way by using examples and at end of lecture providing a lab relating to material discussed. Projects (4) were challenging but he provided much help by using the class exercises and additional lectures to focus on what was needed for projects. Great guy
Alright straight up Tao is the man. Anyone who complains about his accent it just lazy, honestly I pay attention better because I need to focus a little more. He teaches you what you need to know and makes it easily understandable he does not deserve poor reviews.
Older guy, tough subject. He's really boring, show up to the labs to get points, skip the lectures except those before tests. Should be an easy A if you put in some level of work.
Very difficult to undserstand over his heavy accent. He's overally a nice older man but not good at explaining things to you. Class is pretty difficult if you dont know computer lingo. It's basically like taking a language class and the professor doesnt help much. 
He is very hard to understand and jumps from topic to topic during lecture with no real rhyme or reason. The labs were generally easy enough, but you have to essentially teach yourself how to do them via the textbook. He's an easy grader, thankfully, and tests generally were not too hard.
VERY hard to understand. Easy class but I didn't learn a thing. VERY boring lectures
This professor made this class easy.  He was helpful when you asked. If you don't ask questions he will continue on but he will answer your questions.
HORRIBLE professor. Avoid at all costs.
From someone who thought he could deal with a fair-rated professor: Do not take 361 with him. The class is AGONIZINGLY slow and boring, and the shrill, grainy sound of his voice will haunt you at night. Projects are mostly incomprehensible, although labs and exams are easy. Take 361 with Trefftz instead no matter the cost.
VERY hard to understand. His voice puts everyone right to sleep. The lab assignments are easy but I think that only like 2 people got above 80 percents on the exams. I think if it were any other teacher the exams would be easy but it is so hard to pay attention in class, if you even go in the first place (because he doesn't care about attendance.)
He is a really nice guy, but his accent truly makes understand everything difficult, its an easy A, but class is worse than watching paint dry
He is so boring i plug in my I pod and ZONE OUT for an hour, the quizzes are a joke, the labs are a joke, attendance isnt even countred, he is a nice guy, but it seems like he does not care about what he does, he is super unhelpful, but that is only because he doesnt know his subject very well!take him if your VERY lazy, like myself
Worst prof ever.  So boring because he speaks in such a heavy accent you can hardly understand him.  Does not appear to be that hard but class is agonizinly boring.
He was an overall good teacher. You really need to understand the information though to get a decent grade. His tests are fairly easy if you study hard. He is unclear at times (tells you one thing and does another. He thinks he understands what you mean but he really doesn't). I ended up getting an A- because I actually tried hard.
The class is really easy.  Just show up, take notes, do the labs and get an A.  He is probably the most boring person in the world.  He is chinese (or whatever) so he english is broken (at best) but he also mumbles.  Smart guy, but boring.  Rather have him then Hugh Mcguire though.","He can be hard to understand at some points, but he seems to know what he is talking about and is good at teaching the information.

647,"Was my first professor on my first day.  Graduating soon and wish I could thank her
Was one of my favorites in my four year.
openminded    likes to teach
Very nice and Extreamly helpful! Awesome teacher wish she taught more classes!
Shes very nice.",Shes very nice. Awesome teacher wish she taught more classes!
649,"Hard but honest.  Has a nice heart and enjoys teaching.  Sometimes she is more difficult than necessary, but as time goes on, you notice the class getting smaller.  She is only hard b/c she weeds the lazy students out and focuses only on those who are serious.  I made a C but learned more from this C than 100% of the classes i made an A in.
Excellent teacher.  You will learn something from this class.  You will do homework and she goes over it in class calling on students for the answers.  She has a great personality and make you feel as if she is on your level.
She is a really good professor. You will learn in her classes. Is somewhat hard, but no harder than anyone else teaching this class. She is real helpful and knows her stuff...
I thought it was easy, I am an accounting major though so i was actualy interested in the material, probably wouldn't recomend her for non buisiness majors, but great for any buisiness major.
If you are a slacker and just want your degree so you can go on to be a drain on some poor firm, DON'T take this prof., you will learn accounting. I hated acct and dreaded the class. Madden made class fun and educational. I knew I would pass this class but didn't think I would ever like acct.  Due to her style, I no longer hate acct.
Honestly, I don't know why this lady gets bad reviews. She is the best teacher in the business department I have had yet. You don't have to do the homework she gives out only the one's she says she's going to collect. Pretty easy A if you do the homework though as her tests are a direct reflection of the homework.
I had her for a night class, it was horrible. She moved these two people on opposite sides of the room cause she found out they were dating. She gives crazy amounts of busy work and doesn't explain it before or after very well. If at all possible take someone else or go ahead and jump off a roof, cause you're going to feel like it after this class.
Would not help with anything and thought that after she went over it one day in class that u would be able to have a test on it the next class. I couldnt get any help out of her. RUN DONT EVER TAKE HER
Can you say ****!!! This woman is so freaking hard.  Anyone that says she isn't must be an accounting major.  She treats this class like it's a 900 level course.  Drop it if you know what's good for you.  I beat my head in to get a C and it should have been a B. I got a 79.6 and she gave me a C.  I came to class everyday but 3.
Very Hard! Don't Recommend!
Excellent professor!  I had expected it to be miserable, and it was a lot of work, but not difficult.  She is very thorough and expects a lot from the students, but you learn a lot in the end.  Overall, she was the best Accounting professor I had at MSU!
She is horrible. She doesn't understand that you have other classes besides hers. She isn't very helpful and she expects  you to learn on your own. Her tests are horrible with multiple choice.
she sucks. do not take her.  she assigns homework before going over it.  It is due before you go over it, it's crazy, and her tests suck.  DO NOT take her unless you have to.
Best teacher ever.  Hard, though with lots of homework/busywork.  Very clearly teaches lessons.  Expects you to be in class every day.  Teacher of the year in my opinion.
She was very hard.  She gives TONS of homework and doesn't lecture.  She only goes over the homework problems.  There will never be a night without homework, even after a test.
A great teacher. I willingly took her for a second semester. The ONLY downside of her class is alot of homework (busy-work).
She is a great teacher.  If you do your homework and understand it you will do great on her exams, she is very fair.
Imagine the WORST thing ever.  OK if the wost thing you can imagine isn't this class then it's a good thing.  If you don't want it to be this class then don't take it. Homework Homework Homehork Homework............... and more Homework
I agree too much busy work...everyone in the class understands the material, but you still do journal entries!!!!!  does know the materail though!!!","Hard but honest. Excellent teacher. You will learn something from this class. it was a lot of work, but not difficult. though with lots of homework. She only goes over the homework problems. "
650,"Dr. Creahan is so nice. All you have to do is come to class and put in some extra effort to study before tests, etc. I think he is a professor that sees when a student really tries in his class and is willing to help them if they are willing to put forth effort too.
This was so boring. I always dreaded it, and I would almost fall asleep. He lectures the whole time, but it's sooo boring. I learned most things from the textbook.
I only had this class for a few weeks but in those few weeks i realized this class was god awful. Class was boring and not much interaction.
Boring, acts like his class is the only one you have. Gives very vague lectures but asks very specific questions and laughs when you're wrong.
Tom Creahan is the worst professor at MSU. He is soft talker and you literally cannot hear his lectures. I read the chapters before the test and still scored awful. You must take a quiz repeatedly to get a decent/ at least 50% on the test. He gave me the worst grade of my life. Do not take him
When he assigns homework, expect a pop quiz over the material that chapter covers at the beginning of the class. He reads straight off the powerpoints and gets confused when he doesn't. I only got an A because I took the practice test for each exam at least 20 times. He does curve each exam. ATTEND CLASS!!! It goes toward your grade.
This was one of the first courses that I took at Morehead State. He was easy to get a hold of through email and normally replied within 24 hours. Instead of using a normal blackboard course he insisted we mail our assignments to him. When it came to grades, they were not posted on a regular basis, so no way to keep up with your grades.
He uses book questions for the exams so they are really specific and pretty difficult. He's boring and just lectures the whole time. There are a few small assignments during the semester and then a paper at the end. Must get the book if you want to pass the exams because his lectures don't cover all the info. 
Very difficult class for what it is. The book gives very few examples, and quizzes do not always match the book. Online classes seem like they are not a priority with this professor. Assignments released at the last minute, and very little feedback if any. 
Definitely a difficult teacher. Spent my classes outlining chapter because his lectures were so confusing. He talks in circles and teaches as if he is teaching professionals not undergrad. He expects you to always know the answer and material thoroughly, you better make sure you always come to class prepared as he randomly calls on for questions.
I had Dr. Creahan for an FYS and I actually learned a lot, especially as a business major. Be warned that the first half of the class is basically an Economics class, and he does not scale it down. If you talk in class and show effort you will pass his class no problem. Responds to emails pretty quickly. Can be a jerk to his students often.
Not only is he the most boring man alive, he is also rude. If you don't give him the vague answer he has in his head he chastises you in front of the class. Don't speak up, Don't worry no one else knows what he's lecturing about either and Let's all pray he retires soon.
He really is one of the most boring professors I have ever had. I NEVER paid attention in class. If attendance wasn't mandatory, I wouldn't have gone. He seems like a really nice guy though and really willing to help in any way. He just spoke so softly and couldn't keep my attention. Tests were pretty hard but then again, I didn't read the book.
He's not much of a teacher, I just read the whole Macroeconomics textbook and did pretty well in the class. So I'd suggest taking it online if you're not bad at reading. Also, he really is opinionated. He pretty much worships Keynesian economics (then again so does mcgraw hill)
Has trouble conveying his knowledge to students. He sometimes speaks very softy, almost like he is mumbling. He spends a huge amount of time on economic models, while the tests are mostly knowing terms. The tests were difficult, with the curve going from 8 to up to 20 percent, and still people were failing. Global warming was taught for no reason.
Absolutely horrible class. He is very opinionated, and stuffs his beliefs down your throat. Extremely political, even though the class was NOT supposed to involve politics at all. Obsessed with global warming. DREADFUL.
I thought econ101 would be an easy GPA booster. I was very wrong in this case. I really would advise going with a different professor if at all possible. Lectures have nothing to due with quizzes or tests. :(
He is not a bad professor at all.  He tries to teach economics in the best way possible and try's to make it somewhat interesting.  One word of caution in that his lecture do not help for the exam.  Make sure you read the text and if he gives practice quizzes make sure you do them until u memorize it all.
Dr. Creahan is a different kind of teacher. he is fairly unclear in his lectures and very boring, as long as you actually attend he is ok with it. the class over all was kinda lame, but it is econ. it doesnt matter who you take, econ is boring, so i would advise dr. creahan over the others.
Terrible teacher! You would be better off taking an online course! He does not explain material well at all and goes off into random stories and useless information. The tests are not much like the practice tests and the final is comprehensive. Basically the whole class was a blur. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!",This was so boring. He is soft talker and you literally cannot hear his lectures. He uses book questions for the exams so they are really specific and pretty difficult. There are a few small assignments during the semester. Has trouble conveying his knowledge to students.
651,"I found that as long as you show you study an adequate amount, his class was fairly easy. Economics is not my favorite thing, but it wasn't horrible in his class. Participation during class was also really important. 
I don't know why all the students don't like him. His test isn't too bad as long as you study the old exam he gave to you. If you don't understand the old exam, go to his office ask him, he will help you. I think it is a class easy to pass. A lot of my classmate got an A.
I don't understand why all the students don't have good comments for him. His text is easy as long as you study his old exam he gave to you and go to ask him. He has a big curve for the exam. a lot of my classmate got an A.
Take him if you need the class. But come prepared with an energy drink and a coloring book because that is the only way you will last. Check out the books website for help when studying for the test, and go through the practice test on his sight.
Buck is a very boring teacher. Class is not hard. He gives such a huge curve that if you study two days before you can pass easy. I slept through class. He is rather rude and will never let you out of class early. I didnt learn anything. Not a hard class just really boring.
He'll bore you out of your mind, but if you want to pass take Buck.  You wont learn much, but he grades on the curve so everyone that is failing usually gets a C.  He uses old tests as a study guide and he wants you to be there.  I did homework for other classes in there.  I never heard a word and passed with a C.
Buck is the most useless teacher i have ever had. you cant understand anything he teaches cuz it just sounds like a bunch of rambling. His tests are harder than hell and tries to confuse you anyway possible. He gives a huge curve but most ppl still have a bad grade. Very boring, puts me to sleep every class.My advice, STAY AWAY!! HE SUCKS!!
Worst teacher I've ever had, completely useless in every sense of the word.  I was one point away from a B in his class even with his enormous curve, so his joke he calls a class brought down my GPA.
By far the worst professor I have ever encountered.  It is truely sad that a person that sucks this bad at teaching would be allowed to continue working for MSU.
Do not take Roland Buck, His class is so boring, I feel sorry for the person that said that he changed their lives.  You can not understand any of the material, and he does not understand it himself, every time I ever asked him a question he told me to go see the tutor. He does have a huge curve, but it is really pointless.
Do not take his class unless you want to sit through the most boring lectures provided by man. You learn nothing in his class. I was in his class for a few weeks and it was worthless! Roland Buck should not be a teacher.
Horrible teacher who is very boring in class.  He does not explain the material at all but still expects you to understand it.  His tests are so hard that he has to curve them all, but after the curve, most students still have a bad grade.
This is Buck: boring class, big curve, and if you don't like top attend class, then find someone else.  If you take him, show up for class or else you screw yourself.  I would suggest taking ECON 202 with someone like Ghirmay first to understand the concepts first, then you can take Buck for 201 and things should be fairly easy, but boring.
VERY BORING! Although I'm not particularly interested in the material to start with, I'm definitely not now. Tests are hard and he is difficult to understand. I go along with the person who said that they didn't ask for help because they couldn't bear to listen to him anymore.
This man changed my life.  The most intelligent prof.  at MSU  If you want an education and not just a piece of paper, take this class.
""bread and budder"" Talks like a robot, but harder to undrstnd. I feel like a litl kid with ADD. Makes me sleepy does give old tests but you have to know def.s zactly b/c he'll change litl things like and to or. I hate his class b/c he annoys me, but it really isn't that hard. He may help but I never ask b/c I  cant stand to listen to him anymore!
The subject content of this class is very difficult. I had him for an internet class and his lectures were very detailed and explained well on blackboard. He also posted old exams and quiz's to help you study. His tests are really hard, but he has a modified grading scale. He always responded quickly to questions I asked.
He goes on and on and on with a bunch of mumbo jumbo ****.  His teaching style is difficult to comprehend.
Does not relate to the real world, is difficult to understand.  Puts you to sleep, his class is a snoozefest.",His test isn't too bad as long as you study the old exam he gave to you. Buck is a very boring teacher. Class is not hard. He gives such a huge curve.  He does not explain the material at all.
662,"Kind of an annoying man, but the class wasn't bad. Tests were a tad challenging but if you read and study lectures you will be fine. Pop quizzes are opportunity for extra credit. Nothing extraordinary but I would recommend.
Jerome was boring, but easy.
Everyone who commented is someone who does not want to do the work. This is a real college class as in you can't be on your phone or be late, the teacher takes no bs. One of the best classes I've taken at SU, learned a lot. Tests not hard if you actually go to class.
Reading what people wrote about this professor scared me but experienced something entirely different. He is strict. Don't come in late, don't play on your phone or computer. Kinda basic rules in any classroom. He explains things well and welcomes questions and clarifications. Tests are tricky but if you read, go to class, and study you'll be fine.
This is by far the worst professor I have ever had at this University. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. His tests are all trick questions and he is a complete know it all when you want to get help from him. NEVER TAKE ANY OF HIS CLASSES!!
This class sucks, don't take it unless you have to. Class average on the last test was a 70
Very strict, but conveys material very clearly. If you are able to do things his way this is an interesting and enjoyable class.
Stops class when kids come into class late.  Exams- timed like the SAT/ ACT.  While your taking the exam one feels anxiety/ pressured to finish the exam.  First class ever to be timed on exam other than a quiz.  It is not fair to those who needs to take their time/ not enough to recheck their answers.
HE SUCKS! He isn't helpful AT ALL! He talks about his students behind their backs when they are there! Very rude!  Don't take him unless you want to FAIL !!!!
Wow...where do I start? How about synonyms for terrible? This guy SUCKS! He is not helpful at all and lies to the class. He had to wag extra credit points to the class to get us to come to class before break. Then when I asked him about the points, he denied it even happened! AVOID HIM. LIKE THE PLAGUE.
He doesn't answer any questions during the test, then he asks really wordy, round-about questions.  Formula for disaster. Otherwise, you might learn a thing or two..
He's a really smart guy and the lectures are pretty interesting, but the grading system is horrible. If you do bad on one test you better study your a$$ off for the next one.
Easy class if you read the book, clear notes. Most of the tests come straight from the class handouts. If you pay attention, you'll do fine.
Okay, I have him this semester for 335 and 336... yes, the tests require you to read the book basically cover to cover, and yes if you want to do well you should probably go to class.  (But isn't that kind of the point?)  He is funny, the only thing I dislike about him is when students come in late he is condescending.  Otherwise, interesting class
TERRIBLE PROFESSOR!!! worse in psychology department without a doubt
i do not like how the final grade is based on 3 exams.. but his teachings and overall lectures are intresting and u learn a lot. as for his tests... lets just say, it's not easy..
His tests really aren't as insane as everyone says. They are actually rather easy, until you realize that he makes it very likely for you to make stupid mistakes. On a side note though, he is quite condescending and undermines student's intelligence.
WORST TEACHER I EVER HAD. Tests are just rediculous. Do not take.
Worst class ever!
sucks but is dean","Jerome was boring, but easy. Tests are tricky but if you read, go to class, and study you'll be fine.  His tests are all trick questions. Very strict, but conveys material very clearly. If you pay attention, you'll do fine."
664,"He is an all around great guy, loved taking COR 102 with him - the trip was awesome! Only complaint is that he is a little sketchy when it comes to letting you know what is due when. Grades papers pretty rigorously. 
If you don't like Rick, we don't like you!  He is one of the most respected professors among the students.  I graduated in 2007, and I can still recall so many things he said.  I asked him to give me books to read after I graduated, and he brought me into his office, and gave me a few off his own shelf.  It's not about the grade! He changed my life
Would read 60+ pages a night and then have a one question quiz the next day. Boring lectures and gets way off topic to often. Very disorganized.
One of the most transformative classroom experiences I've had in 4 colleges I've attended. Community building, deep introspection, and a real question of success/failure based on a willingness to self-sacrifice for others. Who can teach this stuff? Dr. McPeak. You must commit 100% to the process...it will change your life. And isn't that the point?
He is not available to be talked to if we need him, he assigns homework and books to read but we never go over them in class, very frustrating! He makes no since during class he is very scatter brained and does not stay on one topic for long, he is easily distracted.
Awful.  Very boring.  May know about history, BUT he is cluless when it comes to teaching.
Bad jokes, boring lectures. He assigns busy work he'll never grade. Lots of reading by Peck (boring). Rarely went to class and still got a B.  Anyone can pass if they show up occassionally and complete the busy work. He fills leftover class time with rants on unimportant topics. Lots of group work! Emphasis on (an unattainable)class community.
This class definately made me think and the professor is one of a kind. I think taking a course by this professor should be manditory because he really makes you think. I failed a couple tests, but still received an A, so I think he grades fairly, but gives homework and tests that are SUPER hard.
McPeak has a very strange teaching style. Most of his classes are subversive. His goal is to open eyes, foster deep thought, frustrate with his lack of structure, and stress with impossible tests. Pretty sure his grading is almost purely subjective. If he can tell you are giving everything you've got, you'll get an A. Test scores are irrelevant.
in my opinoin i did not like this class at all. the test were hard and the reading was boring. He isnt a good teacher and would never want him as my teacher again. im sry i just dont like his teacher ability.
Probably one of the worst classes I've ever taken. The whole community concept that he had us all do was an udder failure. We had a fight break out among students in class once, and he let the disagreement run it's course. The class aside, McPeak really is an awesome guy as a person, and the Chicago trip for COR really is awesome.
One of the best men God has made.
Not organized, but he's a very smart man.  Talk to him one on one.
Philosophy of Youth Ministry...GREAT Class.  Book was only Okay, but whatever...he made it better.  McPeak was a great teacher and is always avlaiable to help if you need it.  His class was very easy, but somehow I ended up with a ""B"" in that one...even though all the rest were ""A's""  lol...Rick McPeak was almost always right on...
Amazing man. Just talk to him. Even if you don't have a class with him, if you ever get a chance, just sit with the man and talk. He challenged me in ways I've never been. His class is definitly not as structured as others, but I liked that about him. It was like he was preaching a sermon every class period, and he's good at it. Be prepared to think and not to leave with the same beliefs as when you came in.
Its an open forum.  If you have a question, ask it, and he'll talk about it the whole class.  Don't expect structure.  If you try you will get a good grade, he is friendly with grading and extra points.
I never wanted to be that introspective of my religiousity, but McPeak made it an enjoyable, and most importantly, worthwhile experience... bonus points for barn parties.","He is an all around great guy.

665,"Craig Boyd is probably the most entertaining professor I've ever had.  He is certainly one of the brightest!  He has excellent powers of rhetoric.
Simply the best prof at GC- too bad he left for greener pastures.
Changed my life.
this class was really challenging but in a good, intellectual way. Boyd always made us step out of our mental boxes and challenge ideas to help us know what we believe
Awsoem teacher to be around inside and outside of the class. It's a shame he's no longer around at GC.
He kicks your ass into grad school and teaches you how to defend what you think and to think for yourself!
My favorite prof so far.  Made me love learning about religion.
One of the most brilliant men at GC... and a Cubs fan to boot.
mmm mmm good.
Me No Likey
yeah talks alot but is fun.
Any prof that looks like Jack Nicholson and sings like Bob Dylan? Can't beat that with a stick.
My favorite professor.  We used to play home run softball on the tennis courts.","the most entertaining professor I've ever had. this class was really challenging but in a good, intellectual way. Made me love learning about religion. "
666,"I don't know how this man doesn't have worse than a 3.6. Lectures are boring, long. He doesn't seem to care about students. Grade consists of a few hard bluebook exams. Bans taking notes on laptops apparently
Prof. Green is an extremely intelligent man and academic in his field, but an AWFUL teacher. He is disorganized; lazy; rants; assigns readings he never elaborates on; and treats his TAs poorly, making them do all the work for him.
I dropped the class cause I refuse to pay so much for so little from him. Worst teacher I've had in UD, no competition.
if you don't like long lectures, don't take this class. All the material is super easy to remember/study for the 2 exams and the the 2 term papers are a breeze besides that they have to be 10 pages.
.
does not use canvas at all, only grades are 3 tests that he barely prepares for, doesn't know when tests are and always has a delay pulling it up test day. is unresponsive to questions and leaves it to his TAs to both actually teach in discussions and grade our exams. my TA literally said a slur so I'm sure you can see how that's going. 
Rambles a bit but honestly the tests are really easy if you just take fine enough notes and pay attention. The class isn't very demanding.
He refuses to use canvas.  His lectures are all over the place and the slides make no sense, so you can't rely on them.  Your entire grade consists of three timed written exams in which you barely have enough time to get the information in and then you get the grade back and then is little to no explanation why you got the grade you got.
HARD ASFFFFFFF
he is awful. we had an exam and he went in and took off points after the TAs graded, said we did well when the highest score was an 88, doesnt let you ask questions without snapping at you or making you feel degraded, and refuses to put anything on canvas simply for the fact that he doesnt want to cater to us. he is terrible, find someone else.
Textbook is about as useless as his lectures. He rambles on about unrelated topics and doesn't know that canvas is a thing. If your brave enough to ask a question, get ready for a ""why would I do that?"" response. Constantly undermines what the TA's tell us and the entire class grade is based off of just 3 exams. Man still uses bluebooks, why?
For starters, the TAs grade the tests and if you don't remember the definitions word for word, you'll get points taken off. After the TA's grade the tests, the professor takes off more points. During his lectures, he rambles about anything, but the topic itself. You will learn the same topics over and over again then be tested on different topics. 
Class is extremely boring and he just rambles on about nothing the entire class. He gives no guidance on anything, so you really have to teach yourself for the entire semester. Not helpful. Not a good teacher.
A great professor who knows what he's talking about. Lectures are boring but provide a lot of good information, but in order to succeed you must read the textbook chapters he provides. Going to lectures and reading the textbook will get you an easy A. The first few weeks are boring but he grows on you and I ended up really liking him and the class.
Professor Green is incredibly disorganized in his lectures. He gives little information about each topic and often trails off on to tangents about an unrelated topic during lecture. He is almost impossible to reach outside of class and won't respond to any emails no matter how important it is.
One of the least productive classes I have ever taken at UD. He has a good heart but goes on long tangents that have nothing to do with the course. He assigns weekly readings but none of them match his lectures. He sends out a study guide approx. 48 hours before exams. this is the only way to be prepared & they are about 12 pages long filled out.
Professor Green is the most unorganized Professor Ive ever had. He told us about tests and quizzes just a few days in advance which was extremely unfair. His lectures made no sense because he went on random tangents so I purely had to use the textbook to learn anything. Id never take him again.
He really is a great lecturer because he enjoys the material. Granted, his power point slides are extremely disorganized, but as long as you listen to what he has to say and READ you will be fine.
Tests are all short answer (only 2 + final) and the only grades for the course. After TA's grade & he reviews all exams to take off more points. Lectures are hard to follow and so boring. He was so rude all semester & during the final announced that he specifically picked the terms that would be hardest for the class. No canvas page either. Awful.
This class was not on Canvas. Once given the syllabus you cannot lose it because the assigned readings are on it and not posted anywhere else. The prof does not respond to your emails. Grading criteria is not clear. Lectures are not helpful. TA's are the only helpful ones. I feel I didn't learn anything. Boring, looked up every term on google.","Lectures are boring, long.

668,"Dr. Karplus curves the class generously only because of horrendous exam scores. You have to rely on several hours of pre-lecture videos and memorize the most obscure, abstract details. Exams require you to write down word-for-word definitions for even the slightest bit of credit. Be prepared to read a lot, and utilize the office hours.
Dr. Karplus is a very nice person, but his lectures and slides are not well organized and he expects you to memorize every detail. Points only come from tests and quizzes that grade you on things you have memorized, no note card or calculator allowed. I told Dr. Karplus I caught a graduate student cheating and he did nothing to address it.
Rude when students asked for help on material in office hours and will get in ur face if you look down @ ur notes. Grades only on test and quizzes with no EC. If you don't put down exactly what he wants on the exam, you get no credit. Expects you to read his mind. Makes u watch hours of pre-lecture content. Study guide does not reflect exam content
Only grades on quizzes and exams. Extremely tough grader, and unhelpful in office hours. Appears nice at first, do not be fooled. If I had to choose between a degree in biochemistry taught by this professor or having my limbs removed one by one while being forced to watch Illumination's 'The Lorax' on repeat, I would choose the latter.
Andy really cares about his students learning. That being said, I do think he expects students to pour an unreasonable amount if time into the class. If you want to do well youll need to spend a significant amount of time fully understanding concepts as well as memorizing seemingly minute details.
Andy definitely cares about his students success, and even more that we learn and understand the material. He posts all his lectures so you can rewatch to learn/study, has office hours, and a great attitude. He does expect a lot of detail on exams, so if you want an A you have to know the material front and back.
I have found Dr. Karplus to be an excellent professor for both BB490 and BB494. Though his classes are usually challenging, he is an incredibly thoughtful and caring person who truly cares about the education of his students.
As someone who does not like biochem, it was mandatory to take this class for my major (botany), and I did not really enjoy it. He IS an enthusiastic professor, and clearly has a passion for biochem, but his exam questions are difficult due to the fact that he looks for a VERY specific answer. He is nice but really crams/rushes through information.
Dr. Karplus is great. He basically came in and saved the class. He gives clear lectures, has realistic and clear expectations, and really knows his stuff. Posts lecture videos online which was helpful. Adjusted the curve generously!
He is ok.... Really hard class. He needs to be more organized. Really difficult exams.
Dr. Karplus is a good professor.  He is very devoted to the success of his students.  With that said, BB483 is a difficult class and his contribution to the class was difficult.  However, as seniors we should all be prepared to tackle such topics.  I enjoyed learning from Dr. Karplus despite the difficulty of the final for this class.
Don't take the other ratings as the absolute truth. Dr. Karplus is a great teacher. He is very clear & he repeats important facts 3Xs so you can catch them & then get them right on the exam. He didn't say that evolution did not happen. He said he believes in a higher power. I am agnostic and can see the difference between those 2 statements.
Don't listen to the other posts....he is a great teacher!  Helpful, easy to listen to, and sings songs about biochem in class...i would take a class from him again anytime!
Encouraging and easy to talk to.  Really knows his biochem!  A good communicator and great professor.
a biology teacher who believes the literal translation of the bible (i.e., that evolution did not occur) is an oxymoron.....(emphasis on moron)
if you don't want to retake this class, don't take BB 450 with Karplus. his tests are rediculous. the first two midterm avgs were 45%. horrible teacher overall.
Unfair.  Knows his biochem but is in denial to the fact that he is a horrible teacher.  If he's teaching it DONT take this class unless u want to fail.  Trust me its worth waiting another term for another instructor.
Wow that test was impossible and the grade adjustments were ridiculous.  And after the class average on the test was a 45% he had the nerve to tell us that everyone in the class just needs to study harder!","Dr. Karplus curves the class generously only because of horrendous exam scores. his lectures and slides are not well organized.

670,"Worst ""teacher"" I have ever had. He is very critical of how you do a problem even if you get the same answer as him. His tests are hard and he expects you to know how to do the problems even if he hasn't taught the material yet. His notes are hard to follow and they are useless. You are better off being taught by a tutor in the library. AVOID.
Wow, this might be the worst professor I've ever had. His lectures are INCREDIBLY difficult to follow, and his explanations could not possibly be more unclear. I have no idea how he grades, either; I've never seen a pattern. I would never wish this class on even my worst enemy.
Terrible, terrible teacher. Put me down in class for attending tutoring, made me feel worthless. If you are a calc genius, you might be okay. If not, take someone else.
First time posting on this site just to tell people to NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER. I have over 130 college credit hours and this was the worst teacher I ever had. I'll admit it doesn't help that the course was Calc II, but his problem is that he's been teaching it so long he forgot to know what it's like to be the student.
Absolutely horrible!!! His class was a joke. I was at tutoring more than I was in his class, and I only missed a few classes. By the end I stopped caring, and I got the same exact grades I did from the very beggining when I studied like crazy. I still managed to get a C but I changed my major because of him. He made me HATE math :(
You're better off skipping his class. You won't learn anything in class you wouldn't be better off getting online. His examples are difficult to understand and often don't reflect the material on the test at all. He insists you should read the book as he ""teaches exactly how it is in there"" though if this were true I don't see his function in class
Awful teacher.  Easier to go to drop-in tutoring at the library and learn there rather than sit through class.  Good luck on the tests, the questions are nothing like the homework.  I strongly advise taking a different teacher if you can.
had him for differential equations. Didn't feel like I learned much, even though I tried hard. Had a hard time following his lectures. I too, found him somewhat condescending. I never took another class with him.
had him for differential equations. Didn't feel like I learned much, even though I tried hard. Had a hard time following his lectures. I too, found him somewhat condescending. I made sure never took another class with him.
He's a condescending person, a below-par teacher, and his tests are the hardest tests I've ever encountered. He'll teach basic examples of problems in class, and then throw the hardest possible examples on tests, which will make you pretty much guess your whole way through. You'd have better luck learning calculus from a toddler. Avoid at all costs
Wow.  I'm a math major and I had him for Calc 3 and I barely survived the class with a C.  He is absolutely the worst professor at Kent State.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS
AVOID. If you had calc before you may survive. If not, good luck. You will need it. Unclear explanations and poor teaching run rampant. Seriously. And I say this knowing I will get at least a B in the course. Yeah.
Extremely intelligent professor, but his lectures were sometimes difficult to comprehend.  Always a help when I went to his office.  Exams were easier than the homework.
This university would have no reason to exist without him.
Very unclear in his explainations of concepts.  He also was not willing to answer students questions in class.  Lastly his test did not match what was taught during the chapter(s)! STAY AWAY IF YOU CAN!
One of the best teacher I've ever had. Explanations r easy to catch an idea and get the feeling for the subject, helps to build up intuition. A lot of homeworks and tests, which is important if u r serious about getting knowledge. He has sort of philosophical aproach to teaching which is cool.
The best teacher I've ever had who wasn't very nice to me.
I absolutely DESPISE this teacher. Not only did he never answer my questions in class, he made me cry after telling me I was an idiot and didn't belong in his class. He actually influenced me to go into education so that I will make sure that kids are NEVER treated like this again.
Avoid taking his class at all costs, unless you like to be forced into his office to be told what is wrong with your life.  Almost made a kid cry in our class one day.  Not a good teacher!
VERY condescending...will make you feel like a complete idiot for not understanding his vague and unclear explanations.",His tests are hard. You won't learn anything in class you wouldn't be better off getting online. the questions are nothing like the homework. Unclear explanations and poor teaching run rampant. his lectures were sometimes difficult to comprehend. Very unclear in his explainations of concepts.
672,"I dislike this guy. He is so boring. Dont take him if you dont have to
Doesn't return papers, grades are not given untill the end. Your grade is dependent on his sole opinion of you.
Kind of standoffish but very funny and knowlegable.

Funny at times, clear lecture notes, hard tests, get retake for each test","He is so boring. Doesn't return papers, grades are not given untill the end. clear lecture notes, hard tests, get retake for each test"
673,"I couldn't believe it was an honors class, it was that easy. Even though he says he grades the daily comments and attendance, he doesn't. As long as you speak during class, you'll get on his good side.
Writing 1- He's very chill and laid back, although his voice is soft and put me to sleep. He gives few essays and a lot of in class work. I'd recomend taking his class
Intro to Shakespeare was a great class with him. He was extremely helpful and knows pretty much everything about the plays. Great guy. Take him.
Intro to Shakespeare was a great class. Hubbell isn't extremely dynamic, but is very nice and helpful. Makes insightful commentary and encourages class participation. Attendance isn't mandatory, but it's best to be present for his lectures. If you have to skip, you can easily - all you do is read one Act for each class, so you know what you missed.
College Writing I - This professor is easing going. As long as you are specific, you can ask any question and get and answer. Give you a lot of time to write your papers in class.
Professor Hubble is a really nice man, who is extremely laid back, and although this is an honors course, he does not grad very hard! His voice is soothing, and tended to put me to sleep though! Overall, he is specific and interesting, and i liked his class a lot! really recommend it!
Hubbell is one of the nicest profs I've ever had. He's so sweet that he radiates kindness. He's incredibly knowledgeable about Shakespeare. He is a great teacher and will answer all questions. If you ask enough questions you get 5% extra credit. Tests are a bit hard but pay attention and you should be fine. Attendance is mandatory.
he's a real quite guy but is very willing to help. You definitely need to come to class if you want to pass. You could read on your own but the quotes he goes over in class are the ones that are going to be on exams. He wants your questions so also be sure to ask because Shakespeare is hard. overall - great professor!
Nice teacher. Tests are a little hard, but if you read any pay attention, they're really easy. He's got a great knowledge of Shakespeare, too. Reccomeneded.
As long as you read the plays carefully and attend class/take notes you'll be fine. He provides you with hints before the exam and as long as you actually put the work in you'll be fine. For an English / English Ed major this class should be a piece of cake.
Easiest grader ever.  The class is SO boring but you have to go to get participation points.  If you go to all the classes and do well on the papers (3) you will be fine. It was an easy class and I got an A.  Hes very boring but its worth it, you won't learn anything though.
Hardest teacher ever.  No leniency in grading.  Did all the assignments, thought I was doing great, bombed the exams. Impossible (and I'm an A student)
I really like this teacher! He can be somewhat hard if you don't study but other than that he's awesome.
Boring-to say the least. His lectures are SO scripted, it's rediculous. He taught us how to label an envelope-I wasn't born yesterday. Unhelpful, unqualified and a complete waste of my time.
i dont care what anyone says, this guy put me in a group and didnt let me pick, and when they slacked on 2 projects he would not let me switch groups, that really lowered my grade. he was incredibly unhelpful not to mention very very boring and refused to care about me. what an ****.
By far the easiest class I took this semester. As long as you show up and pay attention you'll be fine. Graded on 3 things: Midterm, 1 paper and final. For the tests he gives you the characters he'll ask from on the exams. Plus he only wants the paper to be less than 1,000 words. Get the idea? Easy.
The easiest class I've had at Kent.  Attendence counts for 15% of your final grade, and the assignments are fairly easy.  Lots of group work, and he's very helpful.
Damn good class, if it hadn't been at a weaird time for me and I always fell asleep.  Fotunately, I knew enough Shakespeare to get by.  Maybe I soaked it up through osmosis though...this guy seriously knew everything about the Bard.
Awesome prof!  Tests were easy, he explained all plays in great detail and made the class interesting!  I want to take another class of his!","He's very chill and laid back, although his voice is soft and put me to sleep. This professor is easing going. you can ask any question and get and answer.

679,"Dr. Kirksy was one of the hardest teachers I have ever had. However I won't regret taking his class ever. Do everything he tells you and you will pass. He is an amazing person and will help you if you put the effort in and try.
He is the professor from your nightmares! He is purposefully intimidating and makes you feel terrible about yourself. Read everything and NEVER miss class . . . even if you are bleeding from your head!
Took this class while in high school. Made B's on all the tests without studying. Also had ample opportunities for extra credit, which pushed me up to a solid A. Very engaging. Strongly urge that you take the class, but don't say ""i don't know"" or he'll throw erasers at you. He still remembers my name to this day.
This is a wonderful teacher! If you pay attention, read, and do the assignments - this is not a bad class. I learned a lot, ignore the negative comments. You'll learn so much by the end of the semester, it'll tie into everything else you do in law or politics.  Oh, and he's hilarious. Most people in our class loved him for the jokes.
By far the best professor ive had as a political science major - gives ample extra credit, thorough study guides and has quite interesting lectures. bottom line is: go to class and you will pass his class and learn a lot more than whats required.
This was an online class with an immense work load.  NO feedback at all on assignment turned in, just a running total that was only updated three times during the semester.  Weekly assignments due and quizzes.  Midterm was impossible and final had 200 questions with a time limit.  Doesn't want to be bothered and points off for questions.
I took his class online. He seemed very thorough with his instructions, and very detailed. When it comes to following those instructions, it's critical. If you really want a good grade in his class, read all his material. He didn't seem arrogant, but expected a lot from his students.
He was the worst professor I have ever had. I was in his honors class and I studied like crazy for all the tests and barely pulled a B. His study guides are basically a list of points in the chapter so just READ!!! If you don't read the text you will fail the class. AVOID his class if at all possible!
Wholly irrelevant lectures that seem to never end. Tests are hard: 60 multiple choice, 60 true/false (most difficult true/false I've ever seen as well), and maybe an essay at the end. Gives out study guides for the tests, but they consist of a list of terms from the chapter. The only hope to a decent grade is his extra credit, make sure to attend!
Had him for online class politics in film. The movies  sucked, he's a slow grader,and hates anything that isnt perfect. must be able to write an amazing essay in 15mins
Minority in Politics of America, he is unorganized, late, doesn't like it when you are late.You never know what he wants. You have TEN papers to write, two exams midterm, final. Attend EVERY CLASS, every point counts for your grade.At the end it get tiring, he repeats the same things over and over again. Know the scientific method inside out!
Notes are extremely important. test are 100 Qs (50 true/false 50 multiple choice)in a normal class period. Start Studying at least a week and a half before. Know the definitions from his lectures backwards. Use every Exra Credit opportunity. if your look for an easy intro class, its not this one but you do learn a lot.
His lectures are so redundant and boring. I feel as though nothing of importance is being taught that isn't already common knowledge.
Horrible! Gave three tests and no other work to help your grade. Study guides were worthless, just listed every name and event in the multiple chapters and you have to look up yourself, most not in book. Never stopped lecturing to see if the class was keeping up. Have to retake this class due to getting a 69 in the class.
His course is tough - he expects you to study hard and learn the material covered. It doesn't all appear on the test - but it's good to know in order to be ""politically literate."" He makes it impossible to fail his course if you try. Non-honors, 500 point course, and he made at least 100 points extra credit available. Study guides covered test q's!
HORRIBLE! asked dumb questions in class that didn't relate to the material and ran on and on about them! Didn't learn anything. Study guides were useless. He basically put all the material on the study guide and used about 1/3 of it on the test. No way to study for his tests.
Very intelligent teacher. You have to study to do well, but you're in college- get used to it. I took the Honors section. Make sure to read the book. He gives study guides that cover everything on the test, so if you prepare yourself this is not that challenging of a course.
He's a great guy with a wealth of knowledge. He's funny, but moody and has a tendency to make snide remarks. The tests are utterly and wholly ridiculous...50 minutes, 50 true/false, 40 multiple choice, 20 free-response, an essay, and 10 bonus questions. 15 out of 20 Honors students made lower than a 60% on the first test.
I have taken two class with him. One being government and the other minority Politics. I really enjoyed him and if possible will take further classes. He demands alot of work but only because he respects you enough to think you can accomplish it.
HONORS POLS- interesting lectures. gives a study guide and video review before each test. watch the review videos, they are extremely helpful- do as much extra credit as you can! overall good course- you will get an A if you work for it.","one of the hardest teachers I have ever had.

680,"He is a cool person, but as a professor, he is unorganized and can be hard to follow along, but he is trying to help you learn and will answer any question. Tests were okay but class average was pretty low. He curves and is generous with grading. If you want to pass, do extra credit and study concepts on your own time (he expects this).
good luck
DO THE EXTRA CREDIT! Extra circuit presentations and powerpoints about EE topics are encouraged. I got an A on the first midterm, worse on the second, and the final. Labs weren't too bad and no homework was due. I thought for sure I would've ended with a B, but it's probably because I didn't take advantage of the extra credit. Good luck.
Although in the beginning it was tough, you'll learn to like Druzgalski, he will do any example if you ask to clarify. Tests are very difficult, conceptual circuit designing questions. Participate and build extra circuits, I failed both midterms, passed the final with a B but I participated in class and built 5 circuits and ended with an A.
Avoid this professor if you can, especially if you haven't been exposed to this type of material. His ""notes"" are a bunch of illegible scribbles on the board and he is kinda hard to understand. Be prepared to do a lot of self-studying as he tends to jump around into material that hasn't been discussed. Presentations and extra credit is a must!
He is a very likable individual. His exams are bearable, even the final. Try to create as many circuits on a bread board so you can understand how the circuit behaves. There certain key concepts he wants yo to understand like the galvanometer 0 current, steady state step response of RC and LR. Make sure you do the hw and work your problems at home.
Should not be a professor. Doesn't teach. Terrible. All we do is present and no one pays attention. He always talks about how his presentations help people get jobs, but I wouldn't want any company to hear me present what I bsed for the class...
Toughest class I have ever taken in my life. The exams are pretty difficult and his questions are vague. However, he does want his students to understand the concept. He is one of the few professors at this university to actually answer questions in class by working out the entire problem until you understand it.
I don't even know where to start. He is absolutely the worst professor on campus. He shouldn't be allowed to teach this course or any course at all. His exams are take home, but they make no sense because he makes them so vague and complex. The ""textbook"" is just a bunch of articles he found strung together. Get ready to suffer all I can say.
Hardly ever lectures. Class is all presentations which contributes very little to the students understanding of the course material. If you ask any of the students what they learned, they won't know how to respond because they did not learn anything. Should not be ""teaching"" this course at all, and he should consider the feedback he gets...
Take advantage of extra credit and turn something in for every class. Read ahead of the class and his lectures will be useful. If you have questions, he'll do any problem on the board for you. Practice as many problems as possible and you'll get an A.
learned more from watching videos online. poor lectures. very disappointed that i had to pay for this class. I wouldn't recommend a fellow student take a class taught by this dude if my life depended on it. horrible experience.
He doesn't really go well in depth with explaining the concepts of designing circuits into the actual implementation of circuits. There were 5 labs, 2 of which I had no clue what I was doing, and with little help. The midterms and final are extremely hard, but there's a curve. Second midterm went from an out of 40 to an out of 23.
a little difficult to understand sometimes but he teaches decently. typically i would use the book to understand better what he went over during class. labs are easy and tests are fair.
Avoid him at all costs, especially if never exposed to logic circuits/EE. Be prepared for disorganized lectures, material not covered to be on exams, and to never know your grade because of his grading system. There is little/no explanation on wiring a breadboard/components, and topics are taught out of order. You'll be better off watching YouTube.
His lectures are totally confused you because he is very unorganized with it. You will get lost during his lecture (I bet). His tests are extremely hard and you will have just a little bit of time to do it. More than half of the class failed on every exams. Good thing, he lets you turn in Extra Credit circuit any times. Do it & you'll survive!
simply awesome
He teaches EE but avoids math like the plague.  I thought it was really interesting how he approached teaching RLC using only the  stuff we learned up to that point and avoiding all the calculus and diff eq.. Grading is weird and unclear. It seems like half of his tests are extra credit but he uses it in a strange way. Do your best you'll be fine
Probably the worst professor I've ever had.  He seems to take joy in giving students low grades, will argue with you when you try to turn in extra credit and refuse to accept it for reasons that were never expressed when he gave the extra credit assignment in the first place, and his lectures will never really teach you anything useful.  AVOID.
Don't take this class with him. You learn on your own plus his tests are nothing like what he talks about in class. He makes you do useless assignments. Lecture time is totally useless. You never know your grade. Don't get surprised when you see a lot of people dropping. Stay away from him",he is unorganized and can be hard to follow along. he is kinda hard to understand. The exams are pretty difficult and his questions are vague. Class is all presentations. material not covered to be on exams.
681,"Helen had a tough semester. Unfortunately I felt I didn't learn much in the class. Bright woman, but not the best teacher. If you put the work in, it shouldn't be hard to get an A. Tests are multiple choice and she may offer extra credit. She is very willing to work with students and accommodate them, but I often found I was teaching myself.
Professor Bowers had a very tough semester while teaching my class, but I would still not recommend. Lectures are long and boring not too much hw or tests though. Easy B hard to get an A.
Bowers is completely unprepared for every class and spends half of it fiddling with her technology or erasing her mistakes. Going to class isn't mandatory because it's a waste of time and you end up being more confused. Take anyone else but her... she doesn't even know how to teach all of the required sections. Very nice lady, but bad teacher. 
Professor Bowers does nothing to keep the class engaged. Extremely boring 1 hour and 15 minutes. I have learned nothing in this class, and am a Finance major. Avoid Bowers at all costs.
very boring but easy test easy class
The subject is tough and she just seems to make it tougher. She is very unorganized, class usually began 15 mins late because she was busy trying to set up the projector. She is also not open to student feedback. After exams she would ask for our feedback and would end the conversation when students said things she didn't agree with. 
Finance is hard in general, not her. She's very helpful and understanding. Homeworks are guaranteed A's bc unlimited attempts, she extends deadlines and gives make up quizzes if needed. Exams are all MC and not the tricky kind, easy if you know how to do the math. She goes over math fast though so you have to slow her down
I was not a fan of Prof. Bowers when I had her for 2 different classes during undergrad.  She was disorganized and unwilling to discuss topics that she was unable to articulate in lectures. Tests were not hard, but once I got into the real world of finance in NYC I realized how little she knew and it all made sense why she hid in academia.
Completely disorganized. Most of the class was spent fixing her computer and technology she tried to use. Forgot to teach information but still decided to test us on the subject and was surprised when many didn't understand it. Didn't follow syllabus or have a real clue as to what was going on, and would regularly show up 20 mins late to class
terrible class. totally disorganized. boring lectures. i didnt learn a thing.
This professor is a disgrace. Arrogant, rude and incompetent. There is nothing you can learn from her.
She is very helpful, but for some reasons she is not clear so, this course became a hard 1 for me. very confusing class. Try some one else.
easy class as long as you read the book. slightly unclear in her teaching. can be moody at times. tests are very easy and she drops the lowest quiz. she holds review sessions for the exam and is available w/e for extra help. would def. take her again.
We spent 1/3 of the class fixing the errors SHE made on slides and calculations. She would give a practice exam and the test would be nothing like it. Wants you to remember every equation there is and only uses 3 on the exam. Always ""forgot"" the formats of the tests so she couldnt answer questions on it. Grades on the cases were completely random.
Not as bad as people say. Not sure why she has such terrible ratings. Not very clear, but material isnt that bad. Easy tests, easy case studies, no cumulative final. Take her, she's nice, and wants her students to do well.
Very boring, very disorganized.  Tests were not that hard.
Not bad at all...Seems like a pretty nice lady who was always willing to help.  I would definitely take her again.  Tests are not that bad at all, just need to study the hw problems.
She really is a great professor! SO helpful, easy to talk to, classes aren't so bad (and she uses powerpt now). It's a hard class, but I would definitely take her again if it didn't have to be in finance!!
Such a nice professor.  Great at explaining financial concepts that apply to the real world. Need to study book and notes to do well on tests.  She rounds grades up if you have good attendance. Take the optional final to help your grade.
couldnt understand what she was talking about--terribly disorganized.  Dont take her, she is a disaster as a prof. how she ever got a phd is mystery.",Extremely boring. The subject is tough and she just seems to make it tougher. She was disorganized and unwilling to discuss topics that she was unable to articulate in lectures.  classes during undergrad.
