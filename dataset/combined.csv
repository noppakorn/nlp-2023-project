3,"Pros:clear plans for the whole semester, course plan and grading standards are good, software is good, never late or absent, a knowledgable professor.        Cons:he is always explaining but not teaching, need to go learn in the book by yourself; examples are modification of tests but terrible handwriting so hard to understand, really boring class."
15,"Kubelka might be the worst professor that I have had at sjsu. I have found that watching a 5-10 minute youtube video is often more helpful that his lectures. He teaches straight from powerpoint, occasionally writing some stuff on the board. His tests are nothing like the homework. Tests are proof based and the homework is more calculations based."
18,Terrible teacher. Lectures are slow and repetitive. Course breadth is extremely narrow. He does not speak good English. He cannot see well enough to read read and makes constant typos. Homework assignments are poorly given without full explanation of grading criteria. He gives free grades increases and extra credit for helping him outside of class.
29,"Great Professor! Would take him again. He is super caring and has a loving and warm attitude, which makes class easy to go to. Take him if you can. Class is paper heavy there are no tests. Gives good instruction on papers though."
45,"He is a better professor than others would indicate.  He cares about students and wants to make a positive impact in their lives.  I only have two issues: there is too much homework and studying for a 0-credit class and the concepts may (only sometimes) be a bit simplistic and specific only to certain situations.  Overall, he is a good professor."
47,"My favorite professor I've had so far! He had such enthusiasm and made a lot of things that could have been boring very interesting. He could be a bit confusing at times, but always went back to go over things we weren't clear on. His exams were very fair and easy as long as you study from the problem sets he provided. Awesome guy, learned a lot."
48,"this class isnt hard, it just goes by slowly. Some of the material is kinda interesting but overall its boring. Shes a nice lady but she reads straight from the notes, so if you miss class you wont miss much."
57,"Absolute sweetheart! She really loves/cares about her students, and knows why literature is important.  Two 10 page papers, a midterm, and a final.  Good reading, she connects it with your life and past historical events. GREAT ENGLISH TEACHER, and GREAT PROFESSOR OVERALL.  I LOVE HER!"
58,a great professor who genuinely cares about his students and trusts them. he is a personable guy and respects everyone's opinions. attendance isn't taken but there are quizzes each class. even though I was allowed two skips I didn't take any because I actually wanted to be in class.
73,"Lecture is completely useless, slides make no sense the first time you see them, and it doesn't help that he blazes through them. Labs are idiotic, and don't help you learn anything, and the text sucks. You'll fail a quiz or two but whatever, everyone does. Discussion was surprisingly helpful. Overall though the class was horrible, as was Xiao."
74,"SHe was very nice and very funny.  Class was easy at first, but got really hard really fast.  She was not helpful, was very bad at explaining things and gave really bad examples.  She did not teach us how to do the assignments for the required lab.  Took way too many hours a week and I was barely able to pass the class."
90,"I took two of his classes so far and enjoyed myself during the lectures. He is passionate about in-class interaction and gives good feedback if you ask for it. Writing, reading, and participation matter in his class since homework is based on textbook understanding and exams are based on lectures comprehension. Great instructor of Asian PHIL study!"
92,"His lectures are so frustrating: he just stands at the board and rambles on without actually checking if you understand it or not.  He gives a normal amount of homework which are pretty hard, but the test questions are always easier than the homework.  You have to put in a lot of individual effort in order to do well."
94,"Very bad professor. if you took AP Biology in high school you should be fine but if you didn't youre out of luck. She goes so fast and just reads off her power points. Tests very hard, 3 and a final(not cumulative). Relied on labs, group projects and the curve."
98,Excellent professor. Highly recommend his course. Very knowledgeable and friendly.
100,"One of the worst classes I have ever taken. The lectures were boring, he solely read off the slides. The exams were fairly difficult and stressful because they were the only thing that counted for a grade. You never actually know you grade either because he goes off of the class average for grading, so we never really knew."
102,"Subject matter and lectures are dry, and there are a lot of them. Overall, Dr. Link explains things pretty clearly and I never had to ask him any questions. He's kind of crotchety when it comes to technology, so be warned about him responding to your emails. Homework is really easy and is actually helpful for tests. Study and you'll do fine"
104,"Best Professor I've ever had. Lectures are clear, concise, and fascinating. Brophy demonstrations lots of knowledge and passion in his field. He covers a lot of detail, but hey, that's how you learn! There are a lot of required readings, but most are interesting. He's not a hard grader to boot. Cannot recommend highly enough."
107,"Boorse is one of the funniest professors I've had at UD. Great sense of humor and extremely intelligent. If you practice problems, logic quickly becomes very interesting and doable. Make a good effort and you'll get a B. 3 tests, first 2 are easy, final is difficult. Class not mandatory but don't skip or you'll be lost. I recommend him."
110,"Dr. Smith is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his area of study and it clearly shows in his teaching. The material is challenging, but you should do okay if you pay attention and take good notes. The lab section of this class is horrendous, but you just have to grit your teeth and do it. Smith makes 8am class not entirely terrible."
111,Worst teacher I have ever had.  Total jerk when you try to get help from him.  Discourages class discussion in a PHILOSOPHY class!!!
114,"Awesome teacher.  Laid back, and explains material very thoroughly. More than willing to answer questions and will often find a way to help you answer your own questions. Will give help if you ask for it."
127,"A very bitter man. You'll never be inspired by him. Otherwise, an easy A if you turn in your stuff on time."
128,"By far the best professor I have ever had! I highly recommend taking Duff. His lectures can be boring, but it's college we're talking about. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to do well and improve. Loved him and wish he was my teacher for every class!!"
131,"He really wants to make you think and learn, not just spit back information.  He's a great guy who makes physics fun and worth all the work you have to put into the class."
132,"Rachana knows how to make her class fun and interesting for everyone regardless of their major or background. She really strives to make everyone feel included and represented and ensures that everyone has a voice in the classroom. She tends to be a bit disorganized, but it's in a fun English teacher kind of way."
137,I was looking forward to this class and was grossly disappointed. Her lecture information is poorly organized and difficult to follow. She doesn't know how to operate anything electronic including turning off caps lock. Her tone and mannerisms are abrasive and obnoxious. Expect to get a snarky response when you ask her to clarify herself and exams.
141,"Grades on class participation but argues any point you bring up making you not want to participate.Very combative. He is ALWAYS right.Comments on paper are not helpful.Not a good communicator of expectations on assignments. If you can get through all of that, there are moments when he says something profound."
142,"Overall, a pretty average class experience. The exams weren't terrible and there was not a crazy amount of work. Lectures definitely get boring and attendance is mandatory if you want the notes, but I have definitely had worse. "
147,"A truly devoted professor and wonderful mentor. He lives and breathes literature, and he really inspires his students to work hard and react personally to the text. Kind, perceptive, and invested in his students. If you want a challenging but fulfilling English experience, take a class with him. It's so sad that he's only here for one more year!"
150,"Professor Levenburg is a very smart person, but not a good professor at all. This is my first time ever writing a review in my four years at Grand Valley. She is a professor who is relatively easy but not worth taking. She is disrespectful to her students when they ask a simple question. Constantly makes mistakes when going over examples, no good."
151,Dr. Good is a realy great proffessor. He really wants his students to do well in his class. Make sure you read the book and his powerpoints. The test weren't too difficult just make sure you read. Studying the powerpoints alone won't get you a good grade. Overall a great prof!
152,Dr. Brewer is a really nice guy but his tests are very challenging. Good students still may not do well. His exam averages are in the 50's most of the time and a lot of students drop his class. He does have great knowledge of the subject though.
154,"I. Love. Dr. Salzarulo. Lectures are straight to the point and he provides a lot of insight through (surprisingly interesting) real-world applications. He does mini-exams once a week over one chapter, which is so much easier to retain than through exams over many chapters. I loved this class and it inspired me to get a supply chain minor."
157,"Prof Bailey is a sweet woman but online isn't her strong suit. The class often had to teach ourselves (this is trig, too). Doesn't teach very well in an online setting."
158,Dr. Ferguson is an amazing prof for CIS163. He really cares that students understand the material and gives a decent amount of help on the projects. This class is a ton of hard work but Ferguson makes it better and is somewhat understanding with grades. His lectures are easy to understand and engaging.
163,Very hard but you learn so much!!
164,"Very smart man, lectures are interesting.  Don't ask him for any help because he won't give you any.  Know EVERYTHING for the tests!!"
165,"Not the worst professor ever, but not necessarily the greatest. Personality-wise, she's sweet and tries her best to connect to students. Her lectures are thorough and explained well. However, she's a VERY strict grader. She'll randomly hand out quizzes or collect homework, so try not to miss class. Take good notes and seek help when needed."
166,"Professor Mays made math very easy to understand, especially for someone that struggles! At the end of every class almost she gives ""quizzes"", but you can work on them with a group of people which helps your grade a lot. She is VERY specific about what will be on exams, including the final, which was SUPER helpful!! Highly recommend!"
168,"Long story short,  AVOID this professor at all costs. Lectures consists of him telling unrelated stories from the 70's and if you're lucky, very brief and vague explanations of class material. Forgets the answers to his questions sometimes. Somehow, I go a good grade thanks to his grading system but I learned NOTHING. "
169,"Professor Buckridge is by far the best professor that i've had at grand valley. His lectures were extremely interesting. He's an amazing professor. His passion for history really shows. If you attend lectures and really listen, the class is super easy. 2 quizzes, 2 exams, 1 paper. not bad at all. take this professor. i promise he's worth it!!!"
170,"Pretty unorganized with syllabus, readings, and general daily lectures. We had a small class, so she definitely noticed if you didn't come or submit something on time. Tries to be helpful, but often made it more confusing. Lectures seemed to be catered to those who had more knowledge on the subject already. Very nice lady, but not a great teacher."
171,"Corey is such a good guy. Honestly, he really cares about his students and he is very intelligent. I learned so much from him and the way I think is completely different after this class. Incredible prof. You have to read a lot in his class. It is not books, but readings online. Tests are 5 multiple choice, one short answer, and three essay."
174,Zeman cares if her students are understanding the material or not. Lectures are not very interesting as she reads off slides but she makes sure everyone understood the concepts. There are in class activities almost every week and she gives a code so you have to attend the lecture. Exams and final was online and honestly not that hard. 
175,"He's a really nice person, and is really smart, but his class was really difficult for me. There was a fair amount of homework and a quiz every week, just make sure you do the homework! The quiz points add up fast, so start off right. His final exam was impossible though."
176,"One of the worst professors I've ever had. Would not recommend taking her because she failed to accommodate student's needs, was degrading, judgmental, and unprofessional in her emails. Overall, she showed poor teaching skills and it was clear she lost her passion to teach and make learning engaging."
177,"Paszek has a great personality, but I wasn't a fan of the class in general. Lectures were kind of pointless; they gave you an idea of the major topics he wanted you to learn, but his exams are chocked full of topics he didn't even mention in-class. Your grade is almost entirely based on the exams, except for one paper. Exams were difficult."
178,Nice guy. Easy class all you have to do is study for the tests. They aren't hard just its an easy class with easy material that you think that you can blow off. He curves grades at the end which is good. Seriously if you study for the tests you'll get an A
182,His teaching style is not effective. Half the exam question are material he does not cover and are very tricky! Many people dropped and many people failed. Its pretty easy to get a B with effort but an A is very hard!I do not recommend him. (He is very nice though)
183,Such a fun lady! Make sure to participate and stay off your phone or you'll be in for a long semester..I'd highly recommend getting on her good side. The tests weren't bad if you studied. The semester long project wasn't bad either-I believe the same as the normal MKT 350 class. I would highly recommend Maria for this class!
184,"Take this review to heart. He is horrible in the sense that he will not teach you about management at all. He gives you every answer for the test so I guess its fairly easy, however, he is a wack-job. Very tough grader on the paper. STAY AWAY FROM HIM AS A PROF. He only teaches what he believes and nothing about management at all. Again, STAY. AWAY"
185,"Loved this prof! Although he never used blackboard and you never knew your grade, as long as you came to class and shared work with your table group you were passing! He definitely knows what he is talking about and has a lot of experience. The lessons we did were fun and useful. I'd take prof Golden again!"
186,"Professor Matchett is an amazing professor. He gives clear explanations and is always willing to help you understand the material. The tests were very tough, but as long as you study and do the weekly readings you'll be fine. Be prepared to work hard for the grade you want. Would definitely recommend taking his class if you can."
187,"I took the honors section and it was a ton of work, but I think that should be expected with an honors class. Super knowledgable lady and she's always there to answer any questions. Exams are tough, but again, in an honors course you should expect that. All in all she was super cool and I really liked her class!"
188,"He keeps class interesting by doing some little fun activities. However, taking notes is hard because he doesn't give a power point,  just and outline. A suggestion I have is to write down every example he gives and evaluate them with the outline."
189,"Actually miserable.  Guy rambles on about god knows what (no religion pun intended), and then expects you to write a paper or take short answer tests and elaborate on extremely vague concepts. Just about everyone in the class is clueless about his expectations. If you're looking for an easy elective and figure this is a good choice think again."
193,"A nice guy, but a TERRIBLE professor. Assigns more assignments than I can count, and tests are EXTREMELY long. Grading criteria is hard to get used to and very specific, but not terrible. He expects almost memorization of the chapter, and his workload is unbelievably high. He does not 'lecture' on material, only answers questions. Do not take him. "
196,"I really enjoyed having Davis! I will admit, sometimes the concepts in his lectures don't immediately click, but he is the most helpful if you go to office hours. I didn't understand how some concepts connected and he spent a hour with me visualizing and reviewing everything before the exam. His exams are not difficult-do the exam review materials."
197,"Her lectures are super boring, and will have you writing until the last minute of class.  She didnt post a study guide for the first test so I bombed it, but once she started posting them for the other 2 I got a BA in the class.  She offered a lot of Extra Credit and the in-class quizzes were easy. I recommend her but bring a pillow to class."
201,"Doc Z. is the best! he is soo funny, he makes boring stuff intersting, he will totally help you out, and his stories are great. You MUST take class with him, hes one of the best profs here!"
202,"Great professor! A bit disorganized, but also willing to go into a direction that the class is interested in going. Provides great exercises for writing and good feedback. Will definitely take more classes with him."
205,"Most laid back prof I have ever had. Tests and quizzes were mainly vocab straight from the book, and if it was anything otherwise, expectations were very clear. The only downside to this class is that there were few chances for points, so doing well on the exams and quizzes was important. Overall is a super cool guy. Even brought his dog in once!"
208,"DG is a great instructor!  He used to be in the Secret Service and it passionate about Criminal Justice and really wants you to understand what he's teaching.  He's funny and tells cool stories about when he was in the Secret Service.  Really fun guy, you should get him if you can!"
210,"LOVED this teacher. He is older so he has stories he likes to tell but he explains the math in such an easy way you don't struggle! NO book needed, it's online. Tests are open book/notes, quizzes can be worked in groups. Easy class but you also learn. I love math now because of this prof!"
211,"DON'T TAKE HIM. In lecture, he just reads the slides word for word. His lectures are so hard to pay attention to because he makes it so boring. When you want to ask him a question he's very rude about it and makes you feel dumb. He expects all of his students to be geniuses. His tests are also very difficult & have mostly written parts."
215,"SUCH AN EASY CLASS. Lets you grade yourself on the final, and on tests. Super laxed. Definitely not the best at teaching but knows his stuff and is super understanding. Just go to class and you'll get at least a B."
216,"Nice Professor.  He makes history interesting.  Great use of media.  Once questions are available on BB for the midterm and final,it is helpful to prepare ahead of time.  He starts posting the questions 2 or 3 weeks before the exam.  You can then paste your answers at exam time."
218,"I'm a Spanish minor and I found this class very fun.  Her stories are hilarious, and if you take good notes and attend most lectures, you will do well. You will not know your grade, but you can guess based on participation and the exams she gives back graded.  She is willing to help after class as well."
220,"Brian genuinely cares about his students. He pushed us to problem-solve rather than simply ""answering"" our questions, and demonstrated tremendous expertise as an English teacher! He gave excellent feedback after observations; critical, but helpful at the same time because his goal was to make me the best teacher possible. Highly Recommended!"
223,"Wonderful teacher. His English is perfectly fine, regardless of what others have said, but he's Korean and he has a Seoul accent.  He's very helpful, replies to emails promptly and will answer all questions you have. Tests are easy if you've done your homework and paid attention.  let you use a sheet of equations on tests."
224,"This lady is no good. She makes things so confusing and doesn't know how to properly teach or grade. She makes the students do work without ever teaching it. Awful. Grading system is terrible, doesn't teach anything so you have no clue what to expect but then she is an incredibly particular grader. Quizzes are bad, from the book without the info."
225,"Professor B was my favorite professor ever. He genuinely cares about his students and helps you actually learn the material and not just memorize it. His teaching style is very interactive and easy to follow along. He always asked if we understood or if we needed him to go back. Literally take him, he is the best. Made calc a 10/10 experience."
227,"Awesome professor! Super energetic and really gets into his lectures, which keeps you interested in what you're learning. He clarifies the material a lot and there's a quiz every week, but they're super easy so just make sure you pay attention and you should do great. Didn't use the textbooks much but you'll need them for some assignments."
228,"Pretty arrogant, always assumes you know nothing about your own project that you've spent the entire semester working on. He really stresses the design process, which is helpful for learning how to take a project from start to finish, but long assignments on that make it hard to actually focus on the project itself, leaving you to cram at the end."
231,"Lockerd is one of the better choices for Honors professors at GV. He has a great sense of humor and does what he can to make his lectures interesting and engaging. He does recognize the amount of work involved in honors and engineering, but that said, he absolutely expects you to read and study - he has little sympathy for slackers."
234,"A horrible man who truly enjoys catching students off guard, calling them out, or trying to make them seem stupid. Very demanding and demeaning. I will say I learned a lot... but I then I could've also learned a lot from someone else who wasn't so mean. Would never take again. Do yourself a favor and avoid if at all possible."
235,Makes labs way longer than they need to be because he wont help you and is not prepared himself.  Assigns enough work for 20 credit hours but you only get 4.  Expects perfection from his students even though his work is shotty.  Avoid him if you can.
236,"Professor Pool is one of kind. She is definitely a master of her profession. She really knows all there is about music and loves passing on her knowledge, love, and enthusiasm of music to her students. Not one day in her class is dull or boring - she always has an upbeat attitude that makes time fly. You will also learn TONS from Prof. Pool!!"
237,"She is honestly one of the best professors I have had at GV. She is so kind and funny, and you can talk to her about anything. She provides amazing feedback on drafts and will do whatever she can to make sure you get the grade you want and worked for. I would definitely take her again if I had the chance!"
238,"Confusing and unclear.  Lectures are scattered.  I often left class confused at what was going on and why.  She seems to be knowledgeable and is passionate about what she is teaching, but ultimately she cannot present it in a clear and understandable manner."
239,"I took Professor Persoon as a freshman and I absolutely loved his class. I looked forward to lectures every week. He encourages creativity alongside analytical thought. The projects were interesting and the essays fairly graded. He was always helpful when I had questions, understanding about absences, and overall encouraged class discussion"
240,Neil is the head of the NRM program so the tests can be hard. You must go to class and pay attention to everything he says for you to do well on his tests. You must study!! He has lots of other grades that will help boost your grade up if you don't do well on his tests. He is a great guy and very helpful when you ask questions.
241,"Rich is a nice guy, but a pretty awful prof.  Hasn't updated his course material since the mid-90's.  Lectures in questions, interrupts students while they are talking, and has vague expectations for projects/assessments.  Easy to get a B, but nearly impossible to get an A.  Take another prof if you can."
242,"She's an amusing woman. The class was not very difficult, contrary to what others might say. She gave the essay questions for the tests in advance, offered lots of opportunities for extra credit and was really enthusiastic about the topics discussed. You have to study the vocab. If you know nothing about politics going in, you'll probably struggle."
244,"Richards is the best prof. Hes super chill and accomodating. He teaches his class in ways that are easy to understand. Very lenient grader. His exams are just like practice quizzes and what he teaches in class, no surprises at all. Ive taken many polisci classes w him and hes the best."
247,"Prof. Estrada is a really nice guy, he tries to crack dry jokes sometimes. However, he has a heavy Columbian accent which makes it kind of tough and boring to focus during lectures. However, he is very intent on teaching his students things that they can put to use in real life, like the night sky and such. Nice guy, just tough to stay awake."
248,"Galen is one of the best professors I've had, lots of dad jokes that keep you engaged. The Content is very easy to understand, I never read the book and did fine. His Exams are word for word from most of his lectures. Its easy, to study for and so much of the quizzes are implied, even if you didn't go to class you can guess and be correct! "
249,"Prof. Reynolds does a good job of keeping things interesting in lecture (does lots of demos, makes jokes, etc.) He teaches the material well but the class is just extremely difficult. Exams are very hard and online homework is harder -I rarely knew what I was doing on the latter. I would definitely recommend Prof. Reynolds for this difficult class."
251,"Scripps isn't a easy teacher. He can be funny and is a genius when it comes to coding, but he doesn't really do a good job teaching it to you. he isn't much help in labs at all either. It's hard at first because I had no programming or coding experience. I learned everything just fine, but mostley by myself with my text book. he's a funny guy tho."
255,"Prof. Lange is great. His lectures are always a blast (even if he does get overly political from time to time) and he enjoys interacting with his students, just don't mention you like Busch. Assignments aren't hard, tests are open note. He's just slow to grade and there's not a ton of assignments, but otherwise, highly recommend this guy.  "
257,"I LOVED Dr. G!! This is a team based learning class, so be sure you work well in groups. A lot of the material you have to teach yourself, but he also goes over the important topics in class and has really good points to make. He gets to know every single student in his class and you can tell that he wants every student to succeed."
259,"Awful prof. Lecture content was outdated and questionable. Terrible at lecturing, would talk super fast and pretty much just read off vague bullet points and never explained anything. Would email her with specific questions and she would give me two word responses that didn't even answer any of my questions. Overall very unhelpful and wouldn't take"
260,"Shes a nice person but her lectures are very boring and kind of hard to follow along. Her examples she gives and whats on tests and quizzes dont match up. If you dont already have a good basic understanding of chem and the math thats used, then take someone else."
262,"Riffe is extremely easy. All you gotta do is come to class and study his cribs and you will pass. He takes attendance by passing back the quizzes and whose ever he gets back, they're marked absent. You take the quizzes on the day he doesn't pass quizzes back so attendance is mandatory. He is boring, but he is the best IME 100 professor to have."
264,He is a very rude professor and expects you to already know the material instead of teaching it properly. His exams are hard and you need to do a lot of independent book studying to pass. If you can avoid taking him then do so!
265,"His lectures may not be the most exciting things in the world, but he explains things fairly well and will treat you as fair as possible.  He has always been consistent; he has 6 quizzes, of which you get to drop two and all of the questions come from the homework.  He will also give out a midterm and a final, which have different questions."
269,"I had Dr. Cole as a prof. and and my college advisor during his time at McKendree College in Lebanon, IL.  He was still completing his PhD at St. Louis U. at the time.  Dr. Cole was tough but extremely helpful and understanding.  I majored in history and thorougly enjoyed all the classes I had with him.  Tough ..... but he really prepared me ."
273,"Prof. Peterman is by far the worst professor I have ever had. She is extremely rude and will respond to you in the shortest, most brief way possible. While she is very knowledgable, lectures are unorganized do little to help students learn.  Homework and labs can be difficult because she expects you to do concepts never covered in class. Avoid her."
274,"This Professor is not my favorite. The reason why is because his teachings are extremely boring and have no enthusiasm what-so-ever. He brags on his background being very egotistic a lot of the times. It's very annoying because he is arrogant for no reason, and we're trying to get there. He knows his material, but have some gaps in teaching it."
275,I loved him but I could see where some people might not. He did a wonderful job getting into the text and explaining the details that might have been missed. I don't think he was a hard grader he just knows what he wants. He was REALLY bad about the papers in that he waited to the LAST min to give them out. He is also extremely friendly and helpful
278,"Prof. Martin teaches like a high school teacher. He focuses more on following unnecessary rules than teaching. Rules include non to few restroom breaks per class, marking students tardy for showing up even a minute late, grading on absences, and leaving early regardless of the reason. While his lectures are okay, his attitude makes him intolerable."
280,Very intimidating.  Demands strict adherence to NASW code of ethics but justifies violation in lecture and advising sessions.  Yells in class at the top of his lungs.  Teaches from the book on occassion otherwise rambles on.  Deviates from a large syllabus. Made offensive personal remarks in class.
282,"Your garunteed to walk out of this class with at least a B  These are some of his first words to you when you come to class.  He is rather entertaining, not a bad guy outside of class, but not really a great teacher.  the class is wotrh a shot, and really not as bad as other have made it out to be"
285,"Rogness was an awesome prof. He is always willing to help students. If you study extensively for the midterm and final (his only tests), you will be fine. He is picky with grading (I got marked for not stapling my paper!). I feel like he did not explain SAS as good as he could but overall, great prof. I recommend."
287,"This was the most pointless, boring class I have ever taken. The professor is very unclear regarding what is expected of you and his grading is all over the place. He is a nice guy and seems to care about his students, but his class was a waste of time and a lot of work. I wouldn't recommend him nor would I recommend LIB 100 in general."
288,"Best class I have ever taken in USC. He was so enthusiastic about what he teaches, always willing to help his students or to discuss anything with his students. Exams are writing essays based on readings and lectures. there's no right/wrong answer but you need to develop your arguments logically. Pay attention to his lectures and do the readings!"
290,"Easily the best professor that I have ever had. She is clear, knowledgeable, and always interested in what you have to say. She helps anyone who needs it, even if it has nothing to do with the class and will help you with every step to reach your goals. Inspirational, supportive, and requires more than 350 characters to describe."
292,Worst teacher I've ever had in my entire educational career.  Complained to the dean about him. The dean said they get complaints all the time but there is nothing they can do about it.  Attending lecture is pointless as he is incomprehensible some days.  Better off staying home and memorizing the powerpoints he post since he just reads from them.
294,"Professor Schneider is nice, but I did not learn anything new from taking her course. She does talk about herself quite often, which cuts into class time. The class was easy, but I felt like I wasted a lot of money. I would recommend taking another professor, simply bc I didn't gain anything from her."
295,"Care about your GPA? Don't take professor Haidar's class. He grades awfully, it is his way or the highway. There were many occasions where I or my peers would get a correct answer and show work, but he didn't like it, so he marked it wrong. He knows the material, just doesn't know how to teach or communicate concepts to the students."
296,Professor Wells is average. The classes are all lectures and the grades come from the work done outside of class. Homework is about 5-10 hours a week. He mixes up his vocabulary sometimes which may confuse you. Each portfolio meeting determines your grade but the final meeting grade on that is all that matters. Focus on the portfolio.
298,"She's a very nice lady, but the class is terribly boring. Read the books and you'll be fine for the tests. Uses power points a lot, and her lectures are usually very boring. Videos are usually entertaining because of how ridiculous they are."
300,Prof Yu is so sweet & likes to connect with her students. She likes for her students to participate & share their experiences relating to the class materials. The textbook homework is easy. A few reading responses & take home exercises. she is very clear ab what is on exams & both were taken online. such a kind woman who really loves her job
302,This man should not be allowed to teach.  Way too critical and aggressive.
303,"Great prof, very caring and nice as a person but had some weak points in her teaching skills. Was always upbeat and lectures were never boring. She is excellent in explaining things but goes through information very fast so always ask for another example or for her to slow down and she will."
309,"Dr Leidig's class was really enjoyable and very different. We read two novels about IT managers to show what it is like in IT departments. Then in class we talk about what lessons can be learned from the cases, Leidig has years of experience and shares examples. Engage with him in class and give your opinion, you will get a higher grade."
310,"I really like professor White. She is very nice and cares about her students. The papers can be a lot to write and revise multiple times, but she makes it very manageable! The activities online are fairly easy and quick. She gives great feedback and wants to see you succeed. The grading criteria is very clear and straightforward"
311,"Fun Italian man...makes lectures as fun as they can get, I guess.  Take home tests...if you miss less than 2 classes, you don't have to take the final!  Overall, a pretty good prof!"
314,"Paul is an interesting dude. One second he is complimenting you and giving good feedback, and the next second he is being unclear in the directions, and tearing your project apart. By the end of the class you end up learning a lot without even realizing it, and producing really good work, but you'll probably pull your hair out and curse his name!!"
315,"Hunt is an amazing person and is hilarious. She tries to keep everyone engaged and you can tell she loves what she does. With that said, this class is not easy. You will work your butt off to maintain a good grade and that still isn't enough sometimes. Her exams are super conceptual and HARD. Take Hunt but be ready to work!"
316,"Larry cares about his students & makes sure everyone understands. He talks a tad fast but you to get used to it. Lectures are very engaging & he includes quick personal stories. Not mandatory to go, but the in class videos are always on exams. 4 exams & 5 quizzes, both lowest are dropped. There's an optional paper if you want to increase your grade"
321,"He is really hard, I would not recommend taking him unless you have lots of spare time. He is really funny and a great teacher, but if you do not understand the material in class, you are out of luck. The class is very fast-paced and he assigns tons of homework. Do not take him if you have a learning disability because he does not understand them."
322,"Worst class I have ever taken.He is arrogant, self-righteous, condescending, and offensive-needs to make the world feel stupid so he can feel smart. Lectures are pointless. If you must take the class, buy the testbank, where almost all test Q's come from"
326,"Great guy, but a VERY difficult teacher... be prepared to work. He tends to favor people who have a passion for the subject. Lots of opportunities to improve your grade though. Extremely difficult, but most interesting class I've ever had."
329,"Prof. Jinn is a very nice guy and has an interesting sense of humor. He uses relevant examples in his lectures , he loves when you ask questions and is always willing to help. My only problem was that I'm not very good at math so it was hard for me to maintain a B. The tests were a little hard to understand but overall, he's pretty good."
331,"His class can be challenging. The lectures are dull at times, and he tends to be a tough grader. But I wouldn't worry too much. He allows unlimited rewrites on every paper except the final. Tripp's an amazing professor. He's funny, caring, and truly wants his students to succeed. At office hours, we talked about fall break and new movies. Great guy"
332,Quite possibly the worst excuse for a teacher I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of being charged with.  To say he can't teach is an understatement.  I'm also not completely sure that HE understands the material we're supposed to be learning.  Mumbles a lot and reads directly from slides that were - no doubt - downloaded right from the web. Stay away!
335,"Great teacher & very helpful. Homework isn't mandatory, but do it and you'll be prepared for exams. Although exams are on exactly what she says, read questions CAREFULLY. She can word things to where you might be tricked. 3 exams & a final, quizzes are easy points, attendance is mandatory. Overall wonderful person"
336,"She is so helpful during office hours but make sure you put in an honest effort and know what questions you want to ask. Also get a study group together because it is very helpful. Do the ""homework"". She is a fair person and while can sometimes make you feel bad, you just improve from her criticisms."
337,"Theres these in class questions every time the class meets, which for me was three days out of the week. Theyre impossibly difficult and no matter how hard I studied for them I still managed to get a good handful wrong. For lecture she reads straight from the book and doesnt explain any of the material. She was kind, and all exams were online."
341,"Hes by far one my my favorite professors here! He's so nice, understadning, and makes lecture/lab alot of fun and interesting, cant say that about many profs. He is very clear on what to expect for exams and doesnt expect you to know every detail but the main concept to your understanding. Hes a pretty easy grader I would say compared to most."
342,"A great guy! He is so kind and allows you to do test corrections on one exam grade that you would like to raise. The material is understandable and he does not try to try trick you in any way on the exams. As long as you do the study guides he posts, you will be prepared . Exams themselves are very fair and he wants everyone to do well! :)"
345,"Lori can be misread. Although she seems to have 'low self-esteem', as someone else mentioned, she is really just quiet. I've had her for a few classes, and her sense of humor is actually excellent. A small snicker from her, though, is like a bellowing laugh from anyone else.Great professor, willing to help, and very engaging. A lot of reading, tho!"
347,The is one entertaining professor.  Hard classes but learn alot. Really cares.
348,"He is a great guy and he is willing to help you!!Class is ok, but if you ask questions and be attentive you will be fine!!!"
349,Although is attire can be shocking...he is really funny!  Pretty easy too!
351,"Professor Smith was a very good teacher. He knows a TON about the biographies behind the authors we read, which often illuminate the text to a whole new level. He is quiet, but only hard to hear when fools in class are chattering. Easily aced his tests, just paid attention. Grades papers pretty softly, not much nit-picking on grammar (thank god)."
352,Professor Byars is awesome!! She lectures out of the book and doesn't use powerpoints so be prepared to take notes. She has a great sense of humor and keeps class fun. Tests are easy and she gives a study guide which will have everything on the test. Class isn't challenging but it's a 100 level. Definitely recommend taking her!
353,Comes across very cold. Difficult exams. Most students have her early (fresh/soph year) and she is DEMANDING - be prepared to WORK. Will help if approached. In my opinion she is too touch on her students for the type of material taught - I have seen much better approaches. Suggest u find another sec
357,"Milt was great!  The class readings were a little dry, lecture was sort of dull, but he was such a nice "
359,"A little disorganized at times, but totally invested in French as a subject and lifestyle, as well as his students as individuals. Really laid back and very flexible. The nicest guy ever, and really funny."
360,"Dr Whipps can be a little difficult to hear as she speaks softly but her words carry a lot of weight.  Assignments every week lots of classroom group interaction, if you are shy you will need to get over it because you will be talking to classmates often.  Take Lib 301 BEFORE you take lib495 and start working on your research paper."
362,Pestana is an extremely wise man. He knows exactly what he's talking about. He's funny and makes lectures as interesting as he can. I had trouble in the beginning with the material and he made accommodations to make sure I'd succeed in the class. He genuinely cares about his students and their experience in his class. I highly recommend taking him
364,He is a really interesting professor. Classes are spent reading the pieces so you really don't have to read out of class and there is no participation necessary. He doesn't use BB which is annoying cause you don't know how you're doing. He is a really nice guy though and you only write 3 papers. That's your grade right there.
366,He is a very nice guy but is not a good teacher. He is super knowledgeable and there is little work required for this class.The exams are impossible and even though they are a scan tron it takes him about two months to get them back and you just get to see your grade.Also it is nearly impossible to get an A.If you want a good grade do not take him.
368,"Professor Blumreich is one of the toughest English professors I have had at GVSU. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed taking her Literary Responses to Death and Dying class. We read a TON, but everything was interesting and made for a great in-class discussion every week. I would recommend her if you are looking for a challenging and helpful prof"
369,Prof Tyson is the best prof ive ever taken at GV. Her class is enjoyable and she makes it interesting. She accepts everyones opinions and will never tell a student that their ideas are wrong. The readings she assigns are great reads and the quizzes are over context and she gives alt quests! TAKE HER! GV is lucky to have her as a professor.
370,"Class is challenging and although he's a nice guy, teaches as if you already are an expert in the subject. Moves quickly and not the best lecturer, but study hard and you can do well. Textbook not needed"
371,"Professor Carlson is very smart, but he jumps around in lectures which makes it very hard to understand what he is talking about. He does not use prepared notes, so you are expected to take notes based on what you understand about the topics. I would not recommend him if you struggle with science classes."
375,"She is not the easiest grader and does appear to favor some students over another.  However, you can revise your papers and they aren't long papers, so its easy to revise till you get an A.  If you don't mind revising, then getting a good grade isn't that hard.  Otherwise, find a more flexible, fair-minded teacher for a better grade."
379,"Madame Kugler is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. She makes an effort to remember everyone's name and greet everyone at the beginning of class, and she really cares about each student's success. I will warn you that you have to be present and participate to pass, but it is not a hard class, even if you're bad at languages like I am."
381,"Literally the worst professor Ive had in my life. Extremely vague grading system where even if you do everything asked you STILL get bad grades for not doing it precisely as she wanted, barely any assignments so that if you do bad on a single one it brings your grade down a lot, and completely inflexible. No extensions allowed. Avoid at all costs."
387,"One of the best professors I've had in my college career. Really cares about the students, and their success. Tells fun and interesting stories about her experiences in Russia. I feel like I learned a lot this semester and didn't need to kill myself doing it."
388,Pemberton was one of my favorite professors at UD. She is so helpful and sweet and always willing to lend a helping hand. She's really patient and her class was pretty easy. Basically if she likes you you'll get a good grade!
389,"Prof. Blacker is super laid back in class and he doesn't really take attendance. Going definitely helps because he'll mention specific terms that are on the tests and taking/adding to your own notes in class is helpful. Other than the 3 exams, there's a short sitting ""presentation"" but that's the extent of the participation and grading."
391,"Professor Poole is absolutely amazing. Although she is a very difficult professor, she is always accessible to her students. If you are having trouble in class, go to office hours, as she is incredibly helpful and kind."
393,"Prof. Celli is one of the nicest professors I have had. She truly wants us to learn French and that comes through in her classes. She really encourages participation, which seems scary at first, but she appreciates the effort even if you make mistakes.  If you do the homework exercises, the tests are easy. Definitely would recommend!"
395,"Dee is the most incredible professor at Rhodes. If you have the chance to take her class, you will learn SO much. Her lectures feel more like a conversation - you can ask questions at any point, & she never fails to make you laugh! She is very accessible outside of class and gives great advice, not only for her classes but also for life. "
398,I liked his class. Sure he can be a little boring at times but that doesnt mean the stuff he chooses to present isnt interesting. I mean you cant teach at Rhodes that long and not be able to just rock the material
399,"Dr. Krumpe is amazing. He is very respected and a super caring professor. He will put in the work with you based on how much work you put in. He is super flexible and will stay late on campus to help you learn. I recommend taking him if you're an athlete; he understands your schedule. He is a challenging professor, but be ready for lots of notes. "
402,"Not very clear on what he is looking for - makes writing papers a bit confusing. Class can be boring at times, but overall, not too bad. It's easy."
403,"Professor Cotter is awesome! Take him if you have the chance, especially if you are a marketing major. He has real life experience to share that relates to everything he teaches which makes lectures interesting and helps you retain information. There are only 3 tests that make up your grade, but he teaches right from the test."
407,"Amazing teacher. Keeps even the most terrible information fun and interesting. Grading is straight forward and clear. Always willing to help you if you're struggling. Easy person to talk to and be around. Expects a lot, but it's never too much. All of her assignments can be done the day before easily, most are note packets."
411,"Professor Newton gets a bad rep, I was warned about how hard of a grader she is and how strict she is. That was not my experience at all, she comes off as strong and stern, but after a few lectures it's obvious that she has a good sense of humor and wants us to do well. She sets clear expectations and if you follow them it's fairly easy to do well."
412,Great Professor; Very Helpful; Challenging
413,By far my favorite professor at UD. Gives great feedback on assignments and genuinely cares about his students and what he's teaching. Class was discussion based on documentaries and readings and would go out of his way to help.
417,"Had to learn most course material on my own, taught very little. Did not grade any assignment until last minute after finals. Very stressful and unorganized."
418,"Not helpful one bit, very unclaer on things and due dates. Nice guy though, funny, easy class."
419,Good professor--native english speaker and very helpful.  Take her section!
422,"St. Pierre is hands down the best professor at UD. Makes class enjoyable with humor and does an outstanding job teaching the challenging material. If you come to class with book and study the homework/class notes, you should do great in this class."
423,"This is the hardest professor I've ever had. She packs WAY too much info into one class and her tests are nearly impossible. She doesn't give study sheets and you can't keep previous exams to study for the CUMULATIVE final. If you don't have to, don't take this professor"
424,"Prof. Haberkorn was great! He was one of those men who you could learn more from hearing stories about him and his beagle rather than lectures on his class. He was also rather old and walked as if he was a newborn deer on ice. Aside from all that, I learned a lot in his class. He also never made mistakes on grading tests or papers which was good!"
425,"VERY BORING! His lectures do not correspond with his tests. Puts questions on tests that weren't even covered in the chapters assigned. A lot of movies that will put you to sleep, only watches the beginning and expects you to know everything about the play. Relates everything to sex...(notice no pepper by his name) TRY TO GET A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR!"
426,he's definitely the best teacher i've had so far at bcc..i love the stories he tells plus he makes the class so much fun rather than a prof who does nothing but lecture with no enthusiasm..im definitely going to try and take another class of his because he is so awesome
431,"Easily one of the best professors I have ever had. She cares about her students and the field that she works in. She has great stories and hosts great lectures! I cannot rave enough about this professor. Definitely, if you get the chance, take a class with this professor."
432,Very passionate and engaging lecturer who does a great job of making some complex and weird ideas easy to understand. There are four tests and the clicker questions as your entire grade. Fairly easy class where paying attention is rewarded. 
433,"He was definately the most entertaining professor I've had so far in college. He is one of the sweetest men I have ever met and is always willing to help his students if they take the time to ask. It's easy to get him to go off on tangents, and if you ask, he'll show you his ice-skating videos. He's great....easy B, at least."
434,"Dr. Smith is probably the sweetest professor you will meet. It is obvious that she cares so much about her students. She was extremely helpful, especially if you go to her office hours. If you don't understand something, she will work with you as long as it takes until you understand. Only negative thing is, paper and exam were very difficult."
435,"Extremely disorganized and unclear. We never knew when things were due, there were no rubrics for grading and criteria was completely unknown, and we could never accomplish all of what she intended in class because she would get very long-winded. Avis is very opinionated and it intimidated people into not expressing their thoughts."
437,"Diann is a very tough grader. Her lectures are well explained, but if you do not study outside of class, you will not pass. I have never felt like such a mediocre student in my life, and I had to WORK for this B. She's very willing to help outside of class, so definitely reach out if you need. It will help you tons."
439,"This guy is terribly boring, not to mention not very friendly. He also talks about his steel drum band constantly. But he's pretty easy and cancels a lot."
441,Great advisor! Always willing to listen and to help.
445,"He is so caring and kind, but having him on a Monday 6-9 was not the best choice! He has a very monotone voice which makes this class hard to listen to because it is late at night. I wish this class was not a 6-9 because it would be so much more engaging. Your expectations are clear, his lectures are just confusing at times. It is an easy A!!"
446,"Funny guy. Willing to help. Tests are challenging so study, read, and take good notes. Angus cruise field trip wasn't the greatest but still entertaining. Can be a tough grader. Interesting class."
449,Avoid this Professor at all costs! He grades hard with extremely vague directions. Very exam heavy. Rarely responds to emails and when he does they are often very short and not helpful. He had zero idea how to use technology. Never posted a single grade the whole semester. He would also yell at students for not understanding the material.
450,Great guy.  Makes class fun and tries to entertain.  Doesn't scare anyone away from business careers.  Extra credits let students teach students.  Always willing to talk to you about anything.   He can relate to college students.  I would have him again.
451,"Excellent professor. Always available via email for help in this hybrid style course. Grades hard on homework, but is more lenient on exams. He is a great lecturer, provides useful tools and videos for reference and is very honest/funny during class. You wont regret you took this class because you learn the materials well. Beware of final project."
453,Professor Fitzgerald is very rude and quite frankly needs to retire. He emailed his students multiple times complaining about us because we had too many questions for him. He messed up our grades on multiple occasions and got upset when we brought it to our attention. Never recommending him to anyone. EVER.
456,"Professor Katz is a hard-working guy that also wants you to be a hard worker. His class isn't easy and he will really want you to participate and work hard. In the end, you'll become a much better writer. He's also nice to talk to and always has interesting things to say"
457,"One of the best teachers I've ever had. He's super organized, clear, and very good at explaining the purpose of learning what we learn in class and how it relates to the bigger picture"
458,"he has the ability to make the class outstanding, and interesting.  but he kills all discusion as soon as he opens his mouth.  he is borring, and slow and i felt like my time was wasted."
462,"Excellent professor, very personable and approachable.  Knows her stuff"
464,"Very nice guy, tries to be funny  and on occasion he's successful.   Good teacher, typical Keynesian though."
466,"Prange was very funny. However, her funnyness didnt mean that the work was easy. The work was hard to me. It required a whole lot understanding what she said. She wrote in script which coule be, at times, annoying because you cant read it. When you are writing notes she speeds up and you cant get a full grasp of the material that she gives."
468,She is an excellent teacher. She explains everything you need to know very thoroughly and she makes it very easy to understand.
470,"He is a great professor, gives excellent feedback, and cares for his students. The only thing is that he does not use canvas; his way of communication is by email. This course requires a coursebook, and there is lots of homework. Overall, he is a great professor."
471,"She is very compassionate with her subject of teaching. I really liked her positive and uplifting personality. And the fact that she is very understanding and makes it her goal to get students to become more ignited in their speeches, helping the audience feel a sense of connection is the best part of her class."
476,"Professor Garrison is very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, she has a lot of busy work that she only collects once in awhile and her lectures are exceedingly boring. However, the powerpoints are posted online."
477,"Do not take him. He is outdated, class does not make sense, so much pointless reading required. Harsh grader, syllabus and online assignments do not match. I didn't do a second part of an assignment because of this. You need to double check all deadline in the syllabus and online."
479,"Julian is an eccentric guy and a good instructor. Even though the texts are old. Some of the things we read for this class made no sense to me, but if you listen to the lectures and take notes, you'll do alright."
480,Criteria is pretty clear. she's not a bad teacher. This class exposes you to a broad array of Spanish genres and writing styles from different time periods which I appreciated.
482,Dennis is very interesting and I find him very entertaining. He grades pretty easily as long as he can tell you put effort into the assignment.
483,"She gives such a good overview of the material that you'll need for the next years. the material is challenging. That being said, the quality of lectures is very good, lots of study materials and it is defiantly possible to do well with effort.the material is challenging. That being said, the quality of lectures is very good, lots of study materials and it is defiantly possible to do well with effort."
485,He speaks quietly. This professor was impossible to please and learn from.
486,she does not stick to her syllabus at all. The books are mostly fiction and worthless.  Only two books are factual.
488,"Yagoda was the best journalism professor I had at UD.  If you want an easy ""A,"" don't take his class. He's a nice guy overall, but very nit-picky and a bit inept at CONSTRUCTIVE criticism."
489,She is super sweet and encouraging and it was great learning from someone who lived in France and knows the culture. She cares so much about her students and it really shows. She is very understanding and a fantastic woman.
490,"Chandra is one of the worst professors to take a fundamental class with. The assignments are not heavy, but he expects you to do more than he assigned."
491,"She's nice, understanding, and helpful. She's very smart and very knowledgable about Shakespeare. I learned so much in this class and enjoyed every minute. Go to class everyday, you'll love it. Hard work, but so worth it."
492,Ross is one of the best professors at UD. Class was only 4 papers and he gave us extensions when he could tell we were all under stress. Class discussions are incredibly interesting and you'll never watch a film the same way again.
493,Professor Arena is very passionate and very educated about what he teaches. One of the most adorable people ever. I remember this man and what I learned in his classes. I refer to him constantly in my work.
494,"He's nice at first but makes for a mess of a professor. I have never been more confused in my LIFE. I  honestly think that if I had gotten a better professor I'd probably be doing a lot better in his class right now. He does give good feedback, but only sometimes. Other times it might just confuse you even more to ask for help."
496,He is very bad teacher. You have to work very hard. Don't take this class.
497,"She is a great teacher. She make learn german fun. Grades super leniently, gives fast/detailed feedback, cares about everyone's knowledge of the course material, calling on individuals to answer questions in German, which helps greatly with the learning experience."
500,"Very smart and very fair professor, lectures make class interesting, and he is very approachable in office hours. Lectures sometimes can get boring but it is a history class."
502,"I enjoyed this class. Papers are pretty easy, and as long as you take good notes on both the books and the lectures."
503,He's a really nice guy but the way he grades homework is actually ridiculous.  He never posted grades or kept track of grades so you don't even know how to fight your grade.
504,He's a funny and sweet man but test is very hard.
505,This professor is the worst ever. Lecture is very boring because of his voice.
506,he isn't very clear on what he wants all the time so you'll need to go to office hours for a better explanation. Absolutely the worst decision I've made at UD so far was to take a class with him. Most arrogant teacher I've ever met.
508,"Worst Professor I've ever had. His accent is very thick, i could barely understand him. He does not convey the lessons well whatsoever, a thick accent definitely acts as a language barrier, and the TA's he chooses are no better."
509,"She is a good professor if you watch the lectures, do the study guides and attend the review sessions."
510,She is one of the best professors. She make the material fairly easy and understandable and really wants everyone to do well.
514,Please don�t take this class. This class is very boring. But I feel much smarter after having taken the class.
515,"Dr. Schneider really knows how to teach organic chem and make it comprehensible. If you go to class, do the problems in the book, and rewrite your notes you can definitely get an A. He's really funny also."
518,"Don't do it very horrible class. Class is boring, you really don't need to go to the lectures No one does, there not that helpful."
524,"very nice and very quiet. He speak quietly. she genuinely loves the material, and class is fun if people participate. i learned a lot in her class and was challenged, but did well."
528,"He often uses movies, art, and even music to spark class discussion, which nicely balances out the literature."
538,"This class is very boring. I sleep in class everyday. He drones on about nothing, then forgets to tell us quizzes are due on WebCT, he shows up late, and expects us to stay late because of it."
541,"He is the cutest old man ever. he is an interesting professor. If you sign up for his class, be aware that Nauen may be the assistant professor and she is extremely boring. "
542,"The professor is nice, response to emails fast, and the essays and discussion posts aren't too bad. However, her quizzes have nothing to do with the lecture material, the modules have so much in them, and the discussions are loosely based off of the content."
543,"She is economically biased in her lectures and is not clear at all especially with the exam questions she uses. This makes the class too hard for an introductory level class.  She'll also skip over major topics that are ""not important""."
544,"This guy is a great professor to have for a film class because he is just in love with the movies. Although you get to watch movies every week, this isn't an easy class. There are 3 papers that make up your entire grade, and he grades the papers extremely hard. A traditional history class is much fairer in grading."
545,Doc is so cute and passionate about hazards. This is the easiest class in the world. You gonna pull off an A regardless.
549,"Teachers were praised for being passionate about the subject and caring for their students, but their lecturing style was sometimes criticized. Some students recommend taking the class for a group requirement, while others suggest looking for older versions of exams to help with studying. Overall, the reviews offer a diverse range of experiences and opinions on the classes and teachers."
560,"He requires attendance, doesn't use Canvas, and provides little feedback on papers. Overall, some found the class to be manageable with effort, but others advise taking a different professor or avoiding the class altogether."
562,"Brueckner is described as a nice, funny, and accommodating professor who genuinely cares about his students. However, some students mention that the class can be difficult and require a lot of time and effort, and one student advises against taking Brueckner if you are a male."
564,"Many students emphasize the importance of devoting a significant amount of time to homework and seeking help from the TA and professor during office hours. Some students mention the class being curved, which may be a factor to consider. Based on the reviews, it seems that the class is doable for students who have a strong foundation in discrete mathematics and are interested in the theory, but it may not be a good fit for those who prefer a more traditional teaching style or are looking for an easy GPA booster."
567,"His teaching style and find the class challenging but worthwhile, while others feel that the class is difficult and boring, and that the TAs are doing most of the teaching. Some students also mention language barriers with the TAs, which can make it harder to understand the material.
